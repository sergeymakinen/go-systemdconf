	// Configure the hardware watchdog at runtime and at reboot. Takes a timeout value in seconds (or in other time units if suffixed

	WatchdogDevice systemdconf.Value

	// Controls which capabilities to include in the capability bounding set for PID 1 and its children. See capabilities for

	// will be included, the effect of the assignment inverted. Note that this option also affects the respective capabilities
	// in the effective, permitted and inheritable capability sets. The capability bounding set may also be individually configured
	// for units using the CapabilityBoundingSet= directive for units, but note that capabilities dropped for PID 1 cannot be
	// regained in individual units, they are lost for good.
	CapabilityBoundingSet systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. If true, ensures that PID 1 and all its children can never gain new privileges through execve (e.g.
	// via setuid or setgid bits, or filesystem capabilities). Defaults to false. General purpose distributions commonly rely
	// on executables with setuid or setgid bits and will thus not function properly with this option enabled. Individual units
	// cannot disable this option. Also see No New Privileges Flag.
	NoNewPrivileges systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a space-separated list of architecture identifiers. Selects from which architectures system calls may be invoked
	// on this system. This may be used as an effective way to disable invocation of non-native binaries system-wide, for example
	// to prohibit execution of 32-bit x86 binaries on 64-bit x86-64 systems. This option operates system-wide, and acts similar
	// to the SystemCallArchitectures= setting of unit files, see systemd.exec for details. This setting defaults to the empty
	// list, in which case no filtering of system calls based on architecture is applied. Known architecture identifiers are
	// "x86", "x86-64", "x32", "arm" and the special identifier "native". The latter implicitly maps to the native architecture
	// of the system (or more specifically, the architecture the system manager was compiled for). Set this setting to "native"
	// to prohibit execution of any non-native binaries. When a binary executes a system call of an architecture that is not listed
	// in this setting, it will be immediately terminated with the SIGSYS signal.
	SystemCallArchitectures systemdconf.Value

	// Sets the timer slack in nanoseconds for PID 1, which is inherited by all executed processes, unless overridden individually,
	// for example with the TimerSlackNSec= setting in service units (for details see systemd.exec). The timer slack controls
	// the accuracy of wake-ups triggered by system timers. See prctl for more information. Note that in contrast to most other
	// time span definitions this parameter takes an integer value in nano-seconds if no unit is specified. The usual time units
	// are understood too.
