	// "none", the tool exits without processing files in the pstore filesystem. When "external" (the default), files are archived
	// into /var/lib/systemd/pstore/, and logged into the journal. When "journal", pstore file contents are logged only in

	Storage systemdconf.Value

	// Controls whether or not files are removed from pstore after processing. Takes a boolean value. When true, a pstore file
	// is removed from the pstore once it has been archived (either to disk or into the journal). When false, processing of pstore
	// files occurs normally, but the files remain in the pstore. The default is true in order to maintain the pstore in a nearly
	// empty state, so that the pstore has storage available for the next kernel error event.
