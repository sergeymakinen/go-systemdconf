	DirectoryNotEmpty systemdconf.Value

	Unit systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. If true, the directories to watch are created before watching. This option is ignored for PathExists=
	// settings. Defaults to false.
	MakeDirectory systemdconf.Value

	// If MakeDirectory= is enabled, use the mode specified here to create the directories in question. Takes an access mode in
