	// Specifies an address to listen on for a stream (SOCK_STREAM), datagram (SOCK_DGRAM), or sequential packet (SOCK_SEQPACKET)
	// socket, respectively. The address can be written in various formats:
	//
	// If the address starts with a slash ("/"), it is read as file system socket in the AF_UNIX socket family.
	//
	// If the address starts with an at symbol ("@"), it is read as abstract namespace socket in the AF_UNIX family. The "@" is replaced
	// with a NUL character before binding. For details, see unix.
	//
	// If the address string is a single number, it is read as port number to listen on via IPv6. Depending on the value of BindIPv6Only=
	// (see below) this might result in the service being available via both IPv6 and IPv4 (default) or just via IPv6.
	//
	// If the address string is a string in the format "v.w.x.y:z", it is interpreted as IPv4 address v.w.x.y and port z.
	//
	// If the address string is a string in the format "[x]:y", it is interpreted as IPv6 address x and port y. An optional interface
	// scope (interface name or number) may be specified after a "%" symbol: "[x]:y%dev". Interface scopes are only useful with
	// link-local addresses, because the kernel ignores them in other cases. Note that if an address is specified as IPv6, it might
	// still make the service available via IPv4 too, depending on the BindIPv6Only= setting (see below).
	//
	// If the address string is a string in the format "vsock:x:y", it is read as CID x on a port y address in the AF_VSOCK family. The
	// CID is a unique 32-bit integer identifier in AF_VSOCK analogous to an IP address. Specifying the CID is optional, and may
	// be set to the empty string. "vsock" may be replaced with "vsock-stream", "vsock-dgram" or "vsock-seqpacket" to force
	// usage of the corresponding socket type.
	//
	// Note that SOCK_SEQPACKET (i.e. ListenSequentialPacket=) is only available for AF_UNIX sockets. SOCK_STREAM (i.e.
	// ListenStream=) when used for IP sockets refers to TCP sockets, SOCK_DGRAM (i.e. ListenDatagram=) to UDP.
	//
	// These options may be specified more than once, in which case incoming traffic on any of the sockets will trigger service
	// activation, and all listed sockets will be passed to the service, regardless of whether there is incoming traffic on them
	// or not. If the empty string is assigned to any of these options, the list of addresses to listen on is reset, all prior uses
	// of any of these options will have no effect.
	//
	// It is also possible to have more than one socket unit for the same service when using Service=, and the service will receive
	// all the sockets configured in all the socket units. Sockets configured in one unit are passed in the order of configuration,
	// but no ordering between socket units is specified.
	//
	// If an IP address is used here, it is often desirable to listen on it before the interface it is configured on is up and running,

	ListenSequentialPacket systemdconf.Value

	// Specifies a file system FIFO (see fifo for details) to listen on. This expects an absolute file system path as argument.
	// Behavior otherwise is very similar to the ListenDatagram= directive above.
	ListenFIFO systemdconf.Value

	// Specifies a special file in the file system to listen on. This expects an absolute file system path as argument. Behavior
	// otherwise is very similar to the ListenFIFO= directive above. Use this to open character device nodes as well as special
	// files in /proc/ and /sys/.
	ListenSpecial systemdconf.Value

	// Specifies a Netlink family to create a socket for to listen on. This expects a short string referring to the AF_NETLINK family
	// name (such as audit or kobject-uevent) as argument, optionally suffixed by a whitespace followed by a multicast group
	// integer. Behavior otherwise is very similar to the ListenDatagram= directive above.
	ListenNetlink systemdconf.Value

	// Specifies a POSIX message queue name to listen on (see mq_overview for details). This expects a valid message queue name
	// (i.e. beginning with "/"). Behavior otherwise is very similar to the ListenFIFO= directive above. On Linux message queue
	// descriptors are actually file descriptors and can be inherited between processes.
	ListenMessageQueue systemdconf.Value

	// Specifies a USB FunctionFS endpoints location to listen on, for implementation of USB gadget functions. This expects
	// an absolute file system path of a FunctionFS mount point as the argument. Behavior otherwise is very similar to the ListenFIFO=
	// directive above. Use this to open the FunctionFS endpoint ep0. When using this option, the activated service has to have
	// the USBFunctionDescriptors= and USBFunctionStrings= options set.
	//
	// Added in version 227.
	ListenUSBFunction systemdconf.Value

	// Takes one of udplite, sctp or mptcp. The socket will use the UDP-Lite (IPPROTO_UDPLITE), SCTP (IPPROTO_SCTP) or MPTCP
	// (IPPROTO_MPTCP) protocol, respectively.
	//
	// Added in version 229.
	SocketProtocol systemdconf.Value

	// Takes one of default, both or ipv6-only. Controls the IPV6_V6ONLY socket option (see ipv6 for details). If both, IPv6 sockets
	// bound will be accessible via both IPv4 and IPv6. If ipv6-only, they will be accessible via IPv6 only. If default (which is
	// the default, surprise!), the system wide default setting is used, as controlled by /proc/sys/net/ipv6/bindv6only,
	// which in turn defaults to the equivalent of both.
	BindIPv6Only systemdconf.Value

	// Takes an unsigned 32-bit integer argument. Specifies the number of connections to queue that have not been accepted yet.
	// This setting matters only for stream and sequential packet sockets. See listen for details. Defaults to 4294967295. Note
	// that this value is silently capped by the "net.core.somaxconn" sysctl, which typically defaults to 4096, so typically
	// the sysctl is the setting that actually matters.
	Backlog systemdconf.Value

	// Specifies a network interface name to bind this socket to. If set, traffic will only be accepted from the specified network
	// interfaces. This controls the SO_BINDTODEVICE socket option (see socket for details). If this option is used, an implicit
	// dependency from this socket unit on the network interface device unit is created (see systemd.device). Note that setting
	// this parameter might result in additional dependencies to be added to the unit (see above).
	BindToDevice systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a UNIX user/group name. When specified, all AF_UNIX sockets, FIFO nodes, and message queues are owned by the specified
	// user and group. If unset (the default), the nodes are owned by the root user/group (if run in system context) or the invoking
	// user/group (if run in user context). If only a user is specified but no group, then the group is derived from the user's default
	// group.
	//
	// Added in version 214.
	SocketUser systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a UNIX user/group name. When specified, all AF_UNIX sockets, FIFO nodes, and message queues are owned by the specified
	// user and group. If unset (the default), the nodes are owned by the root user/group (if run in system context) or the invoking
	// user/group (if run in user context). If only a user is specified but no group, then the group is derived from the user's default
	// group.
	//
	// Added in version 214.
	SocketGroup systemdconf.Value

	// If listening on a file system socket, FIFO, or message queue, this option specifies the file system access mode used when
	// creating the file node. Takes an access mode in octal notation. Defaults to 0666.
	SocketMode systemdconf.Value

	// If listening on a file system socket or FIFO, the parent directories are automatically created if needed. This option specifies
	// the file system access mode used when creating these directories. Takes an access mode in octal notation. Defaults to 0755.
	DirectoryMode systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. If yes, a service instance is spawned for each incoming connection and only the connection socket
	// is passed to it. If no, all listening sockets themselves are passed to the started service unit, and only one service unit
	// is spawned for all connections (also see above). This value is ignored for datagram sockets and FIFOs where a single service
	// unit unconditionally handles all incoming traffic. Defaults to no. For performance reasons, it is recommended to write
	// new daemons only in a way that is suitable for Accept=no. A daemon listening on an AF_UNIX socket may, but does not need to,
	// call close on the received socket before exiting. However, it must not unlink the socket from a file system. It should not
	// invoke shutdown on sockets it got with Accept=no, but it may do so for sockets it got with Accept=yes set. Setting Accept=yes
	// is mostly useful to allow daemons designed for usage with inetd to work unmodified with systemd socket activation.
	//
	// Note that depending on this setting the services activated by units of this type are either regular services (in case of
	// Accept=no) or instances of templated services (in case of Accept=yes). See the Description section above for a more detailed
	// discussion of the naming rules of triggered services.
	//
	// For IPv4 and IPv6 connections, the $REMOTE_ADDR environment variable will contain the remote IP address, and $REMOTE_PORT
	// will contain the remote port. This is the same as the format used by CGI.
	//
	// For AF_UNIX socket connections, the $REMOTE_ADDR environment variable will contain either the remote socket's file
	// system path starting with a slash ("/") or its address in the abstract namespace starting with an at symbol ("@"). If the
	// socket is unnamed, $REMOTE_ADDR will not be set.
	//
	// It is recommended to set CollectMode=inactive-or-failed for service instances activated via Accept=yes, to ensure
	// that failed connection services are cleaned up and released from memory, and do not accumulate.
	Accept systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. May only be used in conjunction with ListenSpecial=. If true, the specified special file is opened
	// in read-write mode, if false, in read-only mode. Defaults to false.
	//
	// Added in version 227.
	Writable systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. May only be used when Accept=no. If yes, the socket's buffers are cleared after the triggered
	// service exited. This causes any pending data to be flushed and any pending incoming connections to be rejected. If no, the
	// socket's buffers will not be cleared, permitting the service to handle any pending connections after restart, which is
	// the usually expected behaviour. Defaults to no.
	//
	// Added in version 247.
	FlushPending systemdconf.Value

	// The maximum number of connections to simultaneously run services instances for, when Accept=yes is set. If more concurrent
	// connections are coming in, they will be refused until at least one existing connection is terminated. This setting has
	// no effect on sockets configured with Accept=no or datagram sockets. Defaults to 64.
	MaxConnections systemdconf.Value

	// The maximum number of connections for a service per source IP address (in case of IPv4/IPv6), per source CID (in case of AF_VSOCK),
	// or source UID (in case of AF_UNIX). This is very similar to the MaxConnections= directive above. Defaults to 0, i.e. disabled.
	//
	// Added in version 232.
	MaxConnectionsPerSource systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. If true, the TCP/IP stack will send a keep alive message after 2h (depending on the configuration
	// of /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_time) for all TCP streams accepted on this socket. This controls the SO_KEEPALIVE
	// socket option (see socket and the TCP Keepalive HOWTO for details.) Defaults to false.
	KeepAlive systemdconf.Value

	// Takes time (in seconds) as argument. The connection needs to remain idle before TCP starts sending keepalive probes. This
	// controls the TCP_KEEPIDLE socket option (see socket and the TCP Keepalive HOWTO for details.) Default value is 7200 seconds
	// (2 hours).
	//
	// Added in version 216.
	KeepAliveTimeSec systemdconf.Value

	// Takes time (in seconds) as argument between individual keepalive probes, if the socket option SO_KEEPALIVE has been set
	// on this socket. This controls the TCP_KEEPINTVL socket option (see socket and the TCP Keepalive HOWTO for details.) Default
	// value is 75 seconds.
	//
	// Added in version 216.
	KeepAliveIntervalSec systemdconf.Value

	// Takes an integer as argument. It is the number of unacknowledged probes to send before considering the connection dead
	// and notifying the application layer. This controls the TCP_KEEPCNT socket option (see socket and the TCP Keepalive HOWTO
	// for details.) Default value is 9.
	//
	// Added in version 216.
	KeepAliveProbes systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. TCP Nagle's algorithm works by combining a number of small outgoing messages, and sending them
	// all at once. This controls the TCP_NODELAY socket option (see tcp). Defaults to false.
	//
	// Added in version 216.
	NoDelay systemdconf.Value

	// Takes an integer argument controlling the priority for all traffic sent from this socket. This controls the SO_PRIORITY
	// socket option (see socket for details.).
	Priority systemdconf.Value

	// Takes time (in seconds) as argument. If set, the listening process will be awakened only when data arrives on the socket,
	// and not immediately when connection is established. When this option is set, the TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT socket option will
	// be used (see tcp), and the kernel will ignore initial ACK packets without any data. The argument specifies the approximate
	// amount of time the kernel should wait for incoming data before falling back to the normal behavior of honoring empty ACK
	// packets. This option is beneficial for protocols where the client sends the data first (e.g. HTTP, in contrast to SMTP),
	// because the server process will not be woken up unnecessarily before it can take any action.
	//
	// If the client also uses the TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT option, the latency of the initial connection may be reduced, because the
	// kernel will send data in the final packet establishing the connection (the third packet in the "three-way handshake").
	//
	// Disabled by default.
	//
	// Added in version 216.
	DeferAcceptSec systemdconf.Value

	// Takes an integer argument controlling the receive or send buffer sizes of this socket, respectively. This controls the
	// SO_RCVBUF and SO_SNDBUF socket options (see socket for details.). The usual suffixes K, M, G are supported and are understood
	// to the base of 1024.
	ReceiveBuffer systemdconf.Value

	// Takes an integer argument controlling the receive or send buffer sizes of this socket, respectively. This controls the
	// SO_RCVBUF and SO_SNDBUF socket options (see socket for details.). The usual suffixes K, M, G are supported and are understood
	// to the base of 1024.
	SendBuffer systemdconf.Value

	// Takes an integer argument controlling the IP Type-Of-Service field for packets generated from this socket. This controls
	// the IP_TOS socket option (see ip for details.). Either a numeric string or one of low-delay, throughput, reliability or
	// low-cost may be specified.
	IPTOS systemdconf.Value

	// Takes an integer argument controlling the IPv4 Time-To-Live/IPv6 Hop-Count field for packets generated from this socket.
	// This sets the IP_TTL/IPV6_UNICAST_HOPS socket options (see ip and ipv6 for details.)
	IPTTL systemdconf.Value

	// Takes an integer value. Controls the firewall mark of packets generated by this socket. This can be used in the firewall
	// logic to filter packets from this socket. This sets the SO_MARK socket option. See iptables for details.
	Mark systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean value. If true, allows multiple binds to this TCP or UDP port. This controls the SO_REUSEPORT socket option.
	// See socket for details.
	//
	// Added in version 206.
	ReusePort systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a string value. Controls the extended attributes "security.SMACK64", "security.SMACK64IPIN" and "security.SMACK64IPOUT",
	// respectively, i.e. the security label of the FIFO, or the security label for the incoming or outgoing connections of the
	// socket, respectively. See Smack for details.
	//
	// Added in version 196.
	SmackLabel systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a string value. Controls the extended attributes "security.SMACK64", "security.SMACK64IPIN" and "security.SMACK64IPOUT",
	// respectively, i.e. the security label of the FIFO, or the security label for the incoming or outgoing connections of the
	// socket, respectively. See Smack for details.
	//
	// Added in version 196.
	SmackLabelIPIn systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a string value. Controls the extended attributes "security.SMACK64", "security.SMACK64IPIN" and "security.SMACK64IPOUT",
	// respectively, i.e. the security label of the FIFO, or the security label for the incoming or outgoing connections of the
	// socket, respectively. See Smack for details.
	//
	// Added in version 196.
	SmackLabelIPOut systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. When true, systemd will attempt to figure out the SELinux label used for the instantiated service
	// from the information handed by the peer over the network. Note that only the security level is used from the information
	// provided by the peer. Other parts of the resulting SELinux context originate from either the target binary that is effectively
	// triggered by socket unit or from the value of the SELinuxContext= option. This configuration option applies only when
	// activated service is passed in single socket file descriptor, i.e. service instances that have standard input connected
	// to a socket or services triggered by exactly one socket unit. Also note that this option is useful only when MLS/MCS SELinux
	// policy is deployed. Defaults to "false".
	//
	// Added in version 217.
	SELinuxContextFromNet systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a size in bytes. Controls the pipe buffer size of FIFOs configured in this socket unit. See fcntl for details. The usual
	// suffixes K, M, G are supported and are understood to the base of 1024.
	PipeSize systemdconf.Value

	// These two settings take integer values and control the mq_maxmsg field or the mq_msgsize field, respectively, when creating
	// the message queue. Note that either none or both of these variables need to be set. See mq_setattr for details.
	MessageQueueMaxMessages systemdconf.Value

	// These two settings take integer values and control the mq_maxmsg field or the mq_msgsize field, respectively, when creating
	// the message queue. Note that either none or both of these variables need to be set. See mq_setattr for details.
	MessageQueueMessageSize systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean value. Controls whether the socket can be bound to non-local IP addresses. This is useful to configure sockets
	// listening on specific IP addresses before those IP addresses are successfully configured on a network interface. This
	// sets the IP_FREEBIND/IPV6_FREEBIND socket option. For robustness reasons it is recommended to use this option whenever
	// you bind a socket to a specific IP address. Defaults to false.
	FreeBind systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean value. Controls the IP_TRANSPARENT/IPV6_TRANSPARENT socket option. Defaults to false.
	Transparent systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean value. This controls the SO_BROADCAST socket option, which allows broadcast datagrams to be sent from
	// this socket. Defaults to false.
	Broadcast systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean value. This controls the SO_PASSCRED socket option, which allows AF_UNIX sockets to receive the credentials
	// of the sending process in an ancillary message. Defaults to false.
	PassCredentials systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean value. This controls the SO_PASSSEC socket option, which allows AF_UNIX sockets to receive the security
	// context of the sending process in an ancillary message. Defaults to false.
	PassSecurity systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean value. This controls the IP_PKTINFO, IPV6_RECVPKTINFO, NETLINK_PKTINFO or PACKET_AUXDATA socket options,
	// which enable reception of additional per-packet metadata as ancillary message, on AF_INET, AF_INET6, AF_UNIX and AF_PACKET
	// sockets. Defaults to false.
	//
	// Added in version 246.
	PassPacketInfo systemdconf.Value

	// Takes one of "off", "us" (alias: "usec", "Î¼s") or "ns" (alias: "nsec"). This controls the SO_TIMESTAMP or SO_TIMESTAMPNS
	// socket options, and enables whether ingress network traffic shall carry timestamping metadata. Defaults to off.
	//
	// Added in version 247.
	Timestamping systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a string value. Controls the TCP congestion algorithm used by this socket. Should be one of "westwood", "reno", "cubic",
	// "lp" or any other available algorithm supported by the IP stack. This setting applies only to stream sockets.
	TCPCongestion systemdconf.Value

	// Takes one or more command lines, which are executed before or after the listening sockets/FIFOs are created and bound,
	// respectively. The first token of the command line must be an absolute filename, then followed by arguments for the process.
	// Multiple command lines may be specified following the same scheme as used for ExecStartPre= of service unit files.
	ExecStartPre systemdconf.Value

	// Takes one or more command lines, which are executed before or after the listening sockets/FIFOs are created and bound,

	ExecStopPre systemdconf.Value

	// Additional commands that are executed before or after the listening sockets/FIFOs are closed and removed, respectively.
	// Multiple command lines may be specified following the same scheme as used for ExecStartPre= of service unit files.
	ExecStopPost systemdconf.Value

	// Configures the time to wait for the commands specified in ExecStartPre=, ExecStartPost=, ExecStopPre= and ExecStopPost=
	// to finish. If a command does not exit within the configured time, the socket will be considered failed and be shut down again.
	// All commands still running will be terminated forcibly via SIGTERM, and after another delay of this time with SIGKILL.
	// (See KillMode= in systemd.kill.) Takes a unit-less value in seconds, or a time span value such as "5min 20s". Pass "0" to
	// disable the timeout logic. Defaults to DefaultTimeoutStartSec= from the manager configuration file (see systemd-system.conf).
	TimeoutSec systemdconf.Value

	// Specifies the service unit name to activate on incoming traffic. This setting is only allowed for sockets with Accept=no.
	// It defaults to the service that bears the same name as the socket (with the suffix replaced). In most cases, it should not
	// be necessary to use this option. Note that setting this parameter might result in additional dependencies to be added to
	// the unit (see above).
	Service systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. If enabled, any file nodes created by this socket unit are removed when it is stopped. This applies
	// to AF_UNIX sockets in the file system, POSIX message queues, FIFOs, as well as any symlinks to them configured with Symlinks=.
	// Normally, it should not be necessary to use this option, and is not recommended as services might continue to run after the
	// socket unit has been terminated and it should still be possible to communicate with them via their file system node. Defaults
	// to off.
	//
	// Added in version 214.
	RemoveOnStop systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a list of file system paths. The specified paths will be created as symlinks to the AF_UNIX socket path or FIFO path
	// of this socket unit. If this setting is used, only one AF_UNIX socket in the file system or one FIFO may be configured for the
	// socket unit. Use this option to manage one or more symlinked alias names for a socket, binding their lifecycle together.
	// Note that if creation of a symlink fails this is not considered fatal for the socket unit, and the socket unit may still start.
	// If an empty string is assigned, the list of paths is reset. Defaults to an empty list.
	//
	// Added in version 214.
	Symlinks systemdconf.Value

	// Assigns a name to all file descriptors this socket unit encapsulates. This is useful to help activated services identify
	// specific file descriptors, if multiple fds are passed. Services may use the sd_listen_fds_with_names call to acquire
	// the names configured for the received file descriptors. Names may contain any ASCII character, but must exclude control
	// characters and ":", and must be at most 255 characters in length. If this setting is not used, the file descriptor name defaults
	// to the name of the socket unit (including its .socket suffix) when Accept=no, "connection" otherwise.
	//
	// Added in version 227.
	FileDescriptorName systemdconf.Value

	// Configures a limit on how often this socket unit may be activated within a specific time interval. The TriggerLimitIntervalSec=
	// setting may be used to configure the length of the time interval in the usual time units "us", "ms", "s", "min", "h", â€¦ and
	// defaults to 2s (See systemd.time for details on the various time units understood). The TriggerLimitBurst= setting takes
	// a positive integer value and specifies the number of permitted activations per time interval, and defaults to 200 for Accept=yes
	// sockets (thus by default permitting 200 activations per 2s), and 20 otherwise (20 activations per 2s). Set either to 0 to
	// disable any form of trigger rate limiting.
	//
	// If the limit is hit, the socket unit is placed into a failure mode, and will not be connectible anymore until restarted. Note
	// that this limit is enforced before the service activation is enqueued.
	//
	// Compare with PollLimitIntervalSec=/PollLimitBurst= described below, which implements a temporary slowdown if a socket
	// unit is flooded with incoming traffic, as opposed to the permanent failure state TriggerLimitIntervalSec=/TriggerLimitBurst=
	// results in.
	//
	// Added in version 230.
	TriggerLimitIntervalSec systemdconf.Value

	// Configures a limit on how often this socket unit may be activated within a specific time interval. The TriggerLimitIntervalSec=

	//
	// Added in version 230.
	TriggerLimitBurst systemdconf.Value

	// Configures a limit on how often polling events on the file descriptors backing this socket unit will be considered. This
	// pair of settings is similar to TriggerLimitIntervalSec=/TriggerLimitBurst= but instead of putting a (fatal) limit
	// on the activation frequency puts a (transient) limit on the polling frequency. The expected parameter syntax and range
	// are identical to that of the aforementioned options, and can be disabled the same way.
	//
	// If the polling limit is hit polling is temporarily disabled on it until the specified time window passes. The polling limit
	// hence slows down connection attempts if hit, but unlike the trigger limit will not cause permanent failures. It's the recommended
	// mechanism to deal with DoS attempts through packet flooding.
	//
	// The polling limit is enforced per file descriptor to listen on, as opposed to the trigger limit which is enforced for the
	// entire socket unit. This distinction matters for socket units that listen on multiple file descriptors (i.e. have multiple
	// ListenXYZ= stanzas).
	//
	// These setting defaults to 150 (in case of Accept=yes) and 15 (otherwise) polling events per 2s. This is considerably lower
	// than the default values for the trigger limit (see above) and means that the polling limit should typically ensure the trigger
	// limit is never hit, unless one of them is reconfigured or disabled.
	//
	// Added in version 255.
