	systemdconf.Section

	// A human readable name for the unit. This is used by systemd (and other UIs) as the label for the unit, so this string should
	// identify the unit rather than describe it, despite the name. "Apache2 Web Server" is a good example. Bad examples are "high-performance
	// light-weight HTTP server" (too generic) or "Apache2" (too specific and meaningless for people who do not know Apache).
	// systemd will use this string as a noun in status messages ("Starting description...", "Started description.", "Reached
	// target description.", "Failed to start description."), so it should be capitalized, and should not be a full sentence
	// or a phrase with a continuous verb. Bad examples include "exiting the container" or "updating the database once per day.".
	Description systemdconf.Value

	// A space-separated list of URIs referencing documentation for this unit or its configuration. Accepted are only URIs of
	// the types "http://", "https://", "file:", "info:", "man:". For more information about the syntax of these URIs, see uri.
	// The URIs should be listed in order of relevance, starting with the most relevant. It is a good idea to first reference documentation
	// that explains what the unit's purpose is, followed by how it is configured, followed by any other related documentation.
	// This option may be specified more than once, in which case the specified list of URIs is merged. If the empty string is assigned
	// to this option, the list is reset and all prior assignments will have no effect.
	Documentation systemdconf.Value

	// Configures (weak) requirement dependencies on other units. This option may be specified more than once or multiple space-separated
	// units may be specified in one option in which case dependencies for all listed names will be created. Dependencies of this
	// type may also be configured outside of the unit configuration file by adding a symlink to a .wants/ directory accompanying
	// the unit file. For details, see above.
	//
	// Units listed in this option will be started if the configuring unit is. However, if the listed units fail to start or cannot
	// be added to the transaction, this has no impact on the validity of the transaction as a whole, and this unit will still be started.
	// This is the recommended way to hook the start-up of one unit to the start-up of another unit.
	//
	// Note that requirement dependencies do not influence the order in which services are started or stopped. This has to be configured
	// independently with the After= or Before= options. If unit foo.service pulls in unit bar.service as configured with Wants=
	// and no ordering is configured with After= or Before=, then both units will be started simultaneously and without any delay
	// between them if foo.service is activated.
	Wants systemdconf.Value

	// Similar to Wants=, but declares a stronger requirement dependency. Dependencies of this type may also be configured by
	// adding a symlink to a .requires/ directory accompanying the unit file.
	//
	// If this unit gets activated, the units listed will be activated as well. If one of the other units fails to activate, and an
	// ordering dependency After= on the failing unit is set, this unit will not be started. Besides, with or without specifying
	// After=, this unit will be stopped if one of the other units is explicitly stopped.
	//
	// Often, it is a better choice to use Wants= instead of Requires= in order to achieve a system that is more robust when dealing
	// with failing services.
	//
	// Note that this dependency type does not imply that the other unit always has to be in active state when this unit is running.
	// Specifically: failing condition checks (such as ConditionPathExists=, ConditionPathIsSymbolicLink=, … — see below)
	// do not cause the start job of a unit with a Requires= dependency on it to fail. Also, some unit types may deactivate on their
	// own (for example, a service process may decide to exit cleanly, or a device may be unplugged by the user), which is not propagated
	// to units having a Requires= dependency. Use the BindsTo= dependency type together with After= to ensure that a unit may
	// never be in active state without a specific other unit also in active state (see below).
	Requires systemdconf.Value

	// Similar to Requires=. However, if the units listed here are not started already, they will not be started and the starting
	// of this unit will fail immediately. Requisite= does not imply an ordering dependency, even if both units are started in
	// the same transaction. Hence this setting should usually be combined with After=, to ensure this unit is not started before
	// the other unit.
	//
	// When Requisite=b.service is used on a.service, this dependency will show as RequisiteOf=a.service in property listing
	// of b.service. RequisiteOf= dependency cannot be specified directly.
	Requisite systemdconf.Value

	// Configures requirement dependencies, very similar in style to Requires=. However, this dependency type is stronger:
	// in addition to the effect of Requires= it declares that if the unit bound to is stopped, this unit will be stopped too. This
	// means a unit bound to another unit that suddenly enters inactive state will be stopped too. Units can suddenly, unexpectedly
	// enter inactive state for different reasons: the main process of a service unit might terminate on its own choice, the backing
	// device of a device unit might be unplugged or the mount point of a mount unit might be unmounted without involvement of the
	// system and service manager.
	//
	// When used in conjunction with After= on the same unit the behaviour of BindsTo= is even stronger. In this case, the unit bound
	// to strictly has to be in active state for this unit to also be in active state. This not only means a unit bound to another unit
	// that suddenly enters inactive state, but also one that is bound to another unit that gets skipped due to a failed condition
	// check (such as ConditionPathExists=, ConditionPathIsSymbolicLink=, … — see below) will be stopped, should it be running.
	// Hence, in many cases it is best to combine BindsTo= with After=.
	//
	// When BindsTo=b.service is used on a.service, this dependency will show as BoundBy=a.service in property listing of b.service.
	// BoundBy= dependency cannot be specified directly.
	BindsTo systemdconf.Value

	// Configures dependencies similar to Requires=, but limited to stopping and restarting of units. When systemd stops or
	// restarts the units listed here, the action is propagated to this unit. Note that this is a one-way dependency — changes to
	// this unit do not affect the listed units.
	//
	// When PartOf=b.service is used on a.service, this dependency will show as ConsistsOf=a.service in property listing of
	// b.service. ConsistsOf= dependency cannot be specified directly.
	PartOf systemdconf.Value

	// A space-separated list of unit names. Configures negative requirement dependencies. If a unit has a Conflicts= setting
	// on another unit, starting the former will stop the latter and vice versa.
	//
	// Note that this setting does not imply an ordering dependency, similarly to the Wants= and Requires= dependencies described
	// above. This means that to ensure that the conflicting unit is stopped before the other unit is started, an After= or Before=
	// dependency must be declared. It doesn't matter which of the two ordering dependencies is used, because stop jobs are always
	// ordered before start jobs, see the discussion in Before=/After= below.
	//
	// If unit A that conflicts with unit B is scheduled to be started at the same time as B, the transaction will either fail (in case
	// both are required parts of the transaction) or be modified to be fixed (in case one or both jobs are not a required part of the
	// transaction). In the latter case, the job that is not required will be removed, or in case both are not required, the unit
	// that conflicts will be started and the unit that is conflicted is stopped.
	Conflicts systemdconf.Value

	// These two settings expect a space-separated list of unit names. They may be specified more than once, in which case dependencies
	// for all listed names are created.
	//
	// Those two settings configure ordering dependencies between units. If unit foo.service contains the setting Before=bar.service
	// and both units are being started, bar.service's start-up is delayed until foo.service has finished starting up. After=
	// is the inverse of Before=, i.e. while Before= ensures that the configured unit is started before the listed unit begins
	// starting up, After= ensures the opposite, that the listed unit is fully started up before the configured unit is started.
	//
	// When two units with an ordering dependency between them are shut down, the inverse of the start-up order is applied. I.e.
	// if a unit is configured with After= on another unit, the former is stopped before the latter if both are shut down. Given two
	// units with any ordering dependency between them, if one unit is shut down and the other is started up, the shutdown is ordered
	// before the start-up. It doesn't matter if the ordering dependency is After= or Before=, in this case. It also doesn't matter
	// which of the two is shut down, as long as one is shut down and the other is started up; the shutdown is ordered before the start-up
	// in all cases. If two units have no ordering dependencies between them, they are shut down or started up simultaneously,
	// and no ordering takes place. It depends on the unit type when precisely a unit has finished starting up. Most importantly,
	// for service units start-up is considered completed for the purpose of Before=/After= when all its configured start-up
	// commands have been invoked and they either failed or reported start-up success. Note that this does includes ExecStartPost=
	// (or ExecStopPost= for the shutdown case).
	//
	// Note that those settings are independent of and orthogonal to the requirement dependencies as configured by Requires=,
	// Wants=, Requisite=, or BindsTo=. It is a common pattern to include a unit name in both the After= and Wants= options, in which
	// case the unit listed will be started before the unit that is configured with these options.
	//
	// Note that Before= dependencies on device units have no effect and are not supported. Devices generally become available
	// as a result of an external hotplug event, and systemd creates the corresponding device unit without delay.
	Before systemdconf.Value

	// These two settings expect a space-separated list of unit names. They may be specified more than once, in which case dependencies
	// for all listed names are created.
	//
	// Those two settings configure ordering dependencies between units. If unit foo.service contains the setting Before=bar.service
	// and both units are being started, bar.service's start-up is delayed until foo.service has finished starting up. After=
	// is the inverse of Before=, i.e. while Before= ensures that the configured unit is started before the listed unit begins

	// as a result of an external hotplug event, and systemd creates the corresponding device unit without delay.
	After systemdconf.Value

	// A space-separated list of one or more units that are activated when this unit enters the "failed" state. A service unit using
	// Restart= enters the failed state only after the start limits are reached.
	OnFailure systemdconf.Value

	// A space-separated list of one or more units where reload requests on this unit will be propagated to, or reload requests
	// on the other unit will be propagated to this unit, respectively. Issuing a reload request on a unit will automatically also
	// enqueue a reload request on all units that the reload request shall be propagated to via these two settings.
	PropagatesReloadTo systemdconf.Value

	// A space-separated list of one or more units where reload requests on this unit will be propagated to, or reload requests
	// on the other unit will be propagated to this unit, respectively. Issuing a reload request on a unit will automatically also
	// enqueue a reload request on all units that the reload request shall be propagated to via these two settings.
	ReloadPropagatedFrom systemdconf.Value

	// For units that start processes (such as service units), lists one or more other units whose network and/or temporary file
	// namespace to join. This only applies to unit types which support the PrivateNetwork=, NetworkNamespacePath= and PrivateTmp=
	// directives (see systemd.exec for details). If a unit that has this setting set is started, its processes will see the same
	// /tmp/, /var/tmp/ and network namespace as one listed unit that is started. If multiple listed units are already started,
	// it is not defined which namespace is joined. Note that this setting only has an effect if PrivateNetwork=/NetworkNamespacePath=
	// and/or PrivateTmp= is enabled for both the unit that joins the namespace and the unit whose namespace is joined.
	JoinsNamespaceOf systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a space-separated list of absolute paths. Automatically adds dependencies of type Requires= and After= for all
	// mount units required to access the specified path.
	//
	// Mount points marked with noauto are not mounted automatically through local-fs.target, but are still honored for the
	// purposes of this option, i.e. they will be pulled in by this unit.
	RequiresMountsFor systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a value of "fail", "replace", "replace-irreversibly", "isolate", "flush", "ignore-dependencies" or "ignore-requirements".
	// Defaults to "replace". Specifies how the units listed in OnFailure= will be enqueued. See systemctl's --job-mode= option
	// for details on the possible values. If this is set to "isolate", only a single unit may be listed in OnFailure=.
	OnFailureJobMode systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. If true, this unit will not be stopped when isolating another unit. Defaults to false for service,
	// target, socket, timer, and path units, and true for slice, scope, device, swap, mount, and automount units.
	IgnoreOnIsolate systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. If true, this unit will be stopped when it is no longer used. Note that, in order to minimize the
	// work to be executed, systemd will not stop units by default unless they are conflicting with other units, or the user explicitly
	// requested their shut down. If this option is set, a unit will be automatically cleaned up if no other active unit requires
	// it. Defaults to false.
	StopWhenUnneeded systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. If true, this unit can only be activated or deactivated indirectly. In this case, explicit start-up
	// or termination requested by the user is denied, however if it is started or stopped as a dependency of another unit, start-up
	// or termination will succeed. This is mostly a safety feature to ensure that the user does not accidentally activate units
	// that are not intended to be activated explicitly, and not accidentally deactivate units that are not intended to be deactivated.
	// These options default to false.
	RefuseManualStart systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. If true, this unit can only be activated or deactivated indirectly. In this case, explicit start-up
	// or termination requested by the user is denied, however if it is started or stopped as a dependency of another unit, start-up
	// or termination will succeed. This is mostly a safety feature to ensure that the user does not accidentally activate units
	// that are not intended to be activated explicitly, and not accidentally deactivate units that are not intended to be deactivated.
	// These options default to false.
	RefuseManualStop systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. If true, this unit may be used with the systemctl isolate command. Otherwise, this will be refused.
	// It probably is a good idea to leave this disabled except for target units that shall be used similar to runlevels in SysV init
	// systems, just as a precaution to avoid unusable system states. This option defaults to false.
	AllowIsolate systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. If yes, (the default), a few default dependencies will implicitly be created for the unit. The
	// actual dependencies created depend on the unit type. For example, for service units, these dependencies ensure that the
	// service is started only after basic system initialization is completed and is properly terminated on system shutdown.
	// See the respective man pages for details. Generally, only services involved with early boot or late shutdown should set
	// this option to no. It is highly recommended to leave this option enabled for the majority of common units. If set to no, this
	// option does not disable all implicit dependencies, just non-essential ones.
	DefaultDependencies systemdconf.Value

	// Tweaks the "garbage collection" algorithm for this unit. Takes one of inactive or inactive-or-failed. If set to inactive
	// the unit will be unloaded if it is in the inactive state and is not referenced by clients, jobs or other units — however it is
	// not unloaded if it is in the failed state. In failed mode, failed units are not unloaded until the user invoked systemctl
	// reset-failed on them to reset the failed state, or an equivalent command. This behaviour is altered if this option is set
	// to inactive-or-failed: in this case the unit is unloaded even if the unit is in a failed state, and thus an explicitly resetting
	// of the failed state is not necessary. Note that if this mode is used unit results (such as exit codes, exit signals, consumed
	// resources, …) are flushed out immediately after the unit completed, except for what is stored in the logging subsystem.
	// Defaults to inactive.
	CollectMode systemdconf.Value

	// Configure the action to take when the unit stops and enters a failed state or inactive state. Takes one of none, reboot, reboot-force,
	// reboot-immediate, poweroff, poweroff-force, poweroff-immediate, exit, and exit-force. In system mode, all options
	// are allowed. In user mode, only none, exit, and exit-force are allowed. Both options default to none.
	//
	// If none is set, no action will be triggered. reboot causes a reboot following the normal shutdown procedure (i.e. equivalent
	// to systemctl reboot). reboot-force causes a forced reboot which will terminate all processes forcibly but should cause
	// no dirty file systems on reboot (i.e. equivalent to systemctl reboot -f) and reboot-immediate causes immediate execution
	// of the reboot system call, which might result in data loss (i.e. equivalent to systemctl reboot -ff). Similarly, poweroff,
	// poweroff-force, poweroff-immediate have the effect of powering down the system with similar semantics. exit causes
	// the manager to exit following the normal shutdown procedure, and exit-force causes it terminate without shutting down
	// services. When exit or exit-force is used by default the exit status of the main process of the unit (if this applies) is returned
	// from the service manager. However, this may be overridden with FailureActionExitStatus=/SuccessActionExitStatus=,
	// see below.
	FailureAction systemdconf.Value

	// Configure the action to take when the unit stops and enters a failed state or inactive state. Takes one of none, reboot, reboot-force,

	// see below.
	SuccessAction systemdconf.Value

	// Controls the exit status to propagate back to an invoking container manager (in case of a system service) or service manager
	// (in case of a user manager) when the FailureAction=/SuccessAction= are set to exit or exit-force and the action is triggered.
	// By default the exit status of the main process of the triggering unit (if this applies) is propagated. Takes a value in the

	// When a job for this unit is queued, a timeout JobTimeoutSec= may be configured. Similarly, JobRunningTimeoutSec= starts

	ConditionVirtualization systemdconf.Value

	// ConditionHost= may be used to match against the hostname or machine ID of the host. This either takes a hostname string (optionally

	// as string (see machine-id). The test may be negated by prepending an exclamation mark.
	ConditionHost systemdconf.Value

	// ConditionKernelCommandLine= may be used to check whether a specific kernel command line option is set (or if prefixed
	// with the exclamation mark — unset). The argument must either be a single word, or an assignment (i.e. two words, separated
	// by "="). In the former case the kernel command line is searched for the word appearing as is, or as left hand side of an assignment.
	// In the latter case, the exact assignment is looked for with right and left hand side matching. This operates on the kernel
	// command line communicated to userspace via /proc/cmdline, except when the service manager is invoked as payload of a container
	// manager, in which case the command line of PID 1 is used instead (i.e. /proc/1/cmdline).
	ConditionKernelCommandLine systemdconf.Value

	// ConditionKernelVersion= may be used to check whether the kernel version (as reported by uname -r) matches a certain expression
	// (or if prefixed with the exclamation mark does not match it). The argument must be a list of (potentially quoted) expressions.
	// For each of the expressions, if it starts with one of "<", "<=", "=", "!=", ">=", ">" a relative version comparison is done,
	// otherwise the specified string is matched with shell-style globs.
	//
	// Note that using the kernel version string is an unreliable way to determine which features are supported by a kernel, because
	// of the widespread practice of backporting drivers, features, and fixes from newer upstream kernels into older versions
	// provided by distributions. Hence, this check is inherently unportable and should not be used for units which may be used
	// on different distributions.
	ConditionKernelVersion systemdconf.Value

	// ConditionEnvironment= may be used to check whether a specific environment variable is set (or if prefixed with the exclamation
	// mark — unset) in the service manager's environment block. The argument may be a single word, to check if the variable with
	// this name is defined in the environment block, or an assignment ("name=value"), to check if the variable with this exact
	// value is defined. Note that the environment block of the service manager itself is checked, i.e. not any variables defined
	// with Environment= or EnvironmentFile=, as described above. This is particularly useful when the service manager runs
	// inside a containerized environment or as per-user service manager, in order to check for variables passed in by the enclosing

	ConditionCapability systemdconf.Value

	// Check whether the system has AC power, or is exclusively battery powered at the time of activation of the unit. This takes
	// a boolean argument. If set to "true", the condition will hold only if at least one AC connector of the system is connected
	// to a power source, or if no AC connectors are known. Conversely, if set to "false", the condition will hold only if there is
	// at least one AC connector known and all AC connectors are disconnected from a power source.
	ConditionACPower systemdconf.Value

	// Takes one of /var/ or /etc/ as argument, possibly prefixed with a "!" (to invert the condition). This condition may be used
	// to conditionalize units on whether the specified directory requires an update because /usr/'s modification time is newer
	// than the stamp file .updated in the specified directory. This is useful to implement offline updates of the vendor operating
	// system resources in /usr/ that require updating of /etc/ or /var/ on the next following boot. Units making use of this condition
	// should order themselves before systemd-update-done.service, to make sure they run before the stamp file's modification
	// time gets reset indicating a completed update.
	//
	// If the systemd.condition-needs-update= option is specified on the kernel command line (taking a boolean), it will override
	// the result of this condition check, taking precedence over any file modification time checks. If it is used systemd-update-done.service
	// will not have immediate effect on any following ConditionNeedsUpdate= checks, until the system is rebooted where the
	// kernel command line option is not specified anymore.
	ConditionNeedsUpdate systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. This condition may be used to conditionalize units on whether the system is booting up for the
	// first time. This roughly means that /etc/ is unpopulated (for details, see "First Boot Semantics" in machine-id). This
	// may be used to populate /etc/ on the first boot after factory reset, or when a new system instance boots up for the first time.
	//
	// For robustness, units with ConditionFirstBoot=yes should order themselves before first-boot-complete.target and
	// pull in this passive target with Wants=. This ensures that in a case of an aborted first boot, these units will be re-run during
	// the next system startup.
	//
	// If the systemd.condition-first-boot= option is specified on the kernel command line (taking a boolean), it will override
	// the result of this condition check, taking precedence over /etc/machine-id existence checks.
	ConditionFirstBoot systemdconf.Value

	// Check for the exists of a file. If the specified absolute path name does not exist, the condition will fail. If the absolute

	ConditionPathIsReadWrite systemdconf.Value

	// ConditionPathIsEncrypted= is similar to ConditionPathExists= but verifies that the underlying file system's backing
	// block device is encrypted using dm-crypt/LUKS. Note that this check does not cover ext4 per-directory encryption, and
	// only detects block level encryption. Moreover, if the specified path resides on a file system on top of a loopback block
	// device, only encryption above the loopback device is detected. It is not detected whether the file system backing the loopback
	// block device is encrypted.

	// file, and marked executable.
	ConditionFileIsExecutable systemdconf.Value

	// ConditionUser= takes a numeric "UID", a UNIX user name, or the special value "@system". This condition may be used to check
	// whether the service manager is running as the given user. The special value "@system" can be used to check if the user id is

	ConditionControlGroupController systemdconf.Value

	// Verify that the specified amount of system memory is available to the current system. Takes a memory size in bytes as argument,

	// same file. In case of template units, systemctl enable must be called with an instance name, and this instance will be added
	// to the .wants/ or .requires/ list of the listed unit. E.g. WantedBy=getty.target in a service getty@.service will result
	// in systemctl enable getty@tty2.service creating a getty.target.wants/getty@tty2.service link to getty@.service.
	RequiredBy systemdconf.Value

	// Additional units to install/deinstall when this unit is installed/deinstalled. If the user requests installation/deinstallation
	// of a unit with this option configured, systemctl enable and systemctl disable will automatically install/uninstall
	// units listed in this option as well.
	//
	// This option may be used more than once, or a space-separated list of unit names may be given.
	Also systemdconf.Value

	// In template unit files, this specifies for which instance the unit shall be enabled if the template is enabled without any
	// explicitly set instance. This option has no effect in non-template unit files. The specified string must be usable as instance
	// identifier.
