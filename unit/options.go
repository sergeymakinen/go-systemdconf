	RootDirectory systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a path to a block device node or regular file as argument. This call is similar to RootDirectory= however mounts a file
	// system hierarchy from a block device node or loopback file instead of a directory. The device node or file system image file
	// needs to contain a file system without a partition table, or a file system within an MBR/MS-DOS or GPT partition table with

	RootImageOptions systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a data integrity (dm-verity) root hash specified in hexadecimal, or the path to a file containing a root hash in ASCII
	// hexadecimal format. This option enables data integrity checks using dm-verity, if the used image contains the appropriate
	// integrity data (see above) or if RootVerity= is used. The specified hash must match the root hash of integrity data, and
	// is usually at least 256 bits (and hence 64 formatted hexadecimal characters) long (in case of SHA256 for example). If this
	// option is not specified, but the image file carries the "user.verity.roothash" extended file attribute (see xattr),
	// then the root hash is read from it, also as formatted hexadecimal characters. If the extended file attribute is not found
	// (or is not supported by the underlying file system), but a file with the .roothash suffix is found next to the image file,
	// bearing otherwise the same name (except if the image has the .raw suffix, in which case the root hash file must not have it
	// in its name), the root hash is read from it and automatically used, also as formatted hexadecimal characters.
	//
	// If the disk image contains a separate /usr/ partition it may also be Verity protected, in which case the root hash may configured
	// via an extended attribute "user.verity.usrhash" or a .usrhash file adjacent to the disk image. There's currently no option
	// to configure the root hash for the /usr/ file system via the unit file directly.
	//
	// This option is only available for system services and is not supported for services running in per-user instances of the
	// service manager.
	RootHash systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a PKCS7 signature of the RootHash= option as a path to a DER-encoded signature file, or as an ASCII base64 string encoding
	// of a DER-encoded signature prefixed by "base64:". The dm-verity volume will only be opened if the signature of the root
	// hash is valid and signed by a public key present in the kernel keyring. If this option is not specified, but a file with the
	// .roothash.p7s suffix is found next to the image file, bearing otherwise the same name (except if the image has the .raw suffix,
	// in which case the signature file must not have it in its name), the signature is read from it and automatically used.
	//
	// If the disk image contains a separate /usr/ partition it may also be Verity protected, in which case the signature for the

	//
	// This option is only available for system services and is not supported for services running in per-user instances of the

	RootHashSignature systemdconf.Value

	// Takes the path to a data integrity (dm-verity) file. This option enables data integrity checks using dm-verity, if RootImage=
	// is used and a root-hash is passed and if the used image itself does not contains the integrity data. The integrity data must
	// be matched by the root hash. If this option is not specified, but a file with the .verity suffix is found next to the image file,
	// bearing otherwise the same name (except if the image has the .raw suffix, in which case the verity data file must not have
	// it in its name), the verity data is read from it and automatically used.
	//
	// This option is supported only for disk images that contain a single file system, without an enveloping partition table.
	// Images that contain a GPT partition table should instead include both root file system and matching Verity data in the same
	// image, implementing the Discoverable Partition Specification.
	//
	// This option is only available for system services and is not supported for services running in per-user instances of the
	// service manager.
	RootVerity systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. If on, a private mount namespace for the unit's processes is created and the API file systems /proc/,
	// /sys/, and /dev/ are mounted inside of it, unless they are already mounted. Note that this option has no effect unless used
	// in conjunction with RootDirectory=/RootImage= as these three mounts are generally mounted in the host anyway, and unless
	// the root directory is changed, the private mount namespace will be a 1:1 copy of the host's, and include these three mounts.
	// Note that the /dev/ file system of the host is bind mounted if this option is used without PrivateDevices=. To run the service
	// with a private, minimal version of /dev/, combine this option with PrivateDevices=.
	//
	// This option is only available for system services and is not supported for services running in per-user instances of the
	// service manager.
	MountAPIVFS systemdconf.Value

	// Takes one of "noaccess", "invisible", "ptraceable" or "default" (which it defaults to). When set, this controls the "hidepid="
	// mount option of the "procfs" instance for the unit that controls which directories with process metainformation (/proc/PID)
	// are visible and accessible: when set to "noaccess" the ability to access most of other users' process metadata in /proc/
	// is taken away for processes of the service. When set to "invisible" processes owned by other users are hidden from /proc/.
	// If "ptraceable" all processes that cannot be ptrace()'ed by a process are hidden to it. If "default" no restrictions on
	// /proc/ access or visibility are made. For further details see The /proc Filesystem. It is generally recommended to run
	// most system services with this option set to "invisible". This option is implemented via file system namespacing, and
	// thus cannot be used with services that shall be able to install mount points in the host file system hierarchy. It also cannot
	// be used for services that need to access metainformation about other users' processes. This option implies MountAPIVFS=.
	//
	// If the kernel doesn't support per-mount point hidepid= mount options this setting remains without effect, and the unit's
	// processes will be able to access and see other process as if the option was not used.
	//
	// This option is only available for system services and is not supported for services running in per-user instances of the
	// service manager.
	ProtectProc systemdconf.Value

	// Takes one of "all" (the default) and "pid". If the latter all files and directories not directly associated with process
	// management and introspection are made invisible in the /proc/ file system configured for the unit's processes. This controls
	// the "subset=" mount option of the "procfs" instance for the unit. For further details see The /proc Filesystem. Note that
	// Linux exposes various kernel APIs via /proc/, which are made unavailable with this setting. Since these APIs are used frequently
	// this option is useful only in a few, specific cases, and is not suitable for most non-trivial programs.
	//
	// Much like ProtectProc= above, this is implemented via file system mount namespacing, and hence the same restrictions
	// apply: it is only available to system services, it disables mount propagation to the host mount table, and it implies MountAPIVFS=.
	// Also, like ProtectProc= this setting is gracefully disabled if the used kernel does not support the "subset=" mount option
	// of "procfs".
	ProcSubset systemdconf.Value

	// Configures unit-specific bind mounts. A bind mount makes a particular file or directory available at an additional place
	// in the unit's view of the file system. Any bind mounts created with this option are specific to the unit, and are not visible
	// in the host's mount table. This option expects a whitespace separated list of bind mount definitions. Each definition
	// consists of a colon-separated triple of source path, destination path and option string, where the latter two are optional.
	// If only a source path is specified the source and destination is taken to be the same. The option string may be either "rbind"
	// or "norbind" for configuring a recursive or non-recursive bind mount. If the destination path is omitted, the option string
	// must be omitted too. Each bind mount definition may be prefixed with "-", in which case it will be ignored when its source
	// path does not exist.
	//
	// BindPaths= creates regular writable bind mounts (unless the source file system mount is already marked read-only), while
	// BindReadOnlyPaths= creates read-only bind mounts. These settings may be used more than once, each usage appends to the

	// prior to this is reset. Note that in this case both read-only and regular bind mounts are reset, regardless which of the two
	// settings is used.
	//
	// This option is particularly useful when RootDirectory=/RootImage= is used. In this case the source path refers to a path
	// on the host file system, while the destination path refers to a path below the root directory of the unit.
	//
	// Note that the destination directory must exist or systemd must be able to create it. Thus, it is not possible to use those
	// options for mount points nested underneath paths specified in InaccessiblePaths=, or under /home/ and other protected
	// directories if ProtectHome=yes is specified. TemporaryFileSystem= with ":ro" or ProtectHome=tmpfs should be used
	// instead.

	//
	// This option is only available for system services and is not supported for services running in per-user instances of the

	BindReadOnlyPaths systemdconf.Value

	// This setting is similar to RootImage= in that it mounts a file system hierarchy from a block device node or loopback file,
	// but the destination directory can be specified as well as mount options. This option expects a whitespace separated list
	// of mount definitions. Each definition consists of a colon-separated tuple of source path and destination definitions,
	// optionally followed by another colon and a list of mount options.
	//
	// Mount options may be defined as a single comma-separated list of options, in which case they will be implicitly applied
	// to the root partition on the image, or a series of colon-separated tuples of partition name and mount options. Valid partition
	// names and mount options are the same as for RootImageOptions= setting described above.
	//
	// Each mount definition may be prefixed with "-", in which case it will be ignored when its source path does not exist. The source
	// argument is a path to a block device node or regular file. If source or destination contain a ":", it needs to be escaped as
	// "\:". The device node or file system image file needs to follow the same rules as specified for RootImage=. Any mounts created
	// with this option are specific to the unit, and are not visible in the host's mount table.

	//
	// This option is only available for system services and is not supported for services running in per-user instances of the
	// service manager.
	MountImages systemdconf.Value

	// Set the UNIX user or group that the processes are executed as, respectively. Takes a single user or group name, or a numeric
	// ID as argument. For system services (services run by the system service manager, i.e. managed by PID 1) and for user services
	// of the root user (services managed by root's instance of systemd --user), the default is "root", but User= may be used to
	// specify a different user. For user services of any other user, switching user identity is not permitted, hence the only
	// valid setting is the same user the user's service manager is running as. If no group is set, the default group of the user is
	// used. This setting does not affect commands whose command line is prefixed with "+".
	//
	// Note that this enforces only weak restrictions on the user/group name syntax, but will generate warnings in many cases
	// where user/group names do not adhere to the following rules: the specified name should consist only of the characters a-z,
	// A-Z, 0-9, "_" and "-", except for the first character which must be one of a-z, A-Z and "_" (i.e. digits and "-" are not permitted
	// as first character). The user/group name must have at least one character, and at most 31. These restrictions are made in
	// order to avoid ambiguities and to ensure user/group names and unit files remain portable among Linux systems. For further
	// details on the names accepted and the names warned about see User/Group Name Syntax.
	//
	// When used in conjunction with DynamicUser= the user/group name specified is dynamically allocated at the time the service
	// is started, and released at the time the service is stopped â€” unless it is already allocated statically (see below). If DynamicUser=
	// is not used the specified user and group must have been created statically in the user database no later than the moment the
	// service is started, for example using the sysusers.d facility, which is applied at boot or package install time. If the
	// user does not exist by then program invocation will fail.
	//
	// If the User= setting is used the supplementary group list is initialized from the specified user's default group list,
	// as defined in the system's user and group database. Additional groups may be configured through the SupplementaryGroups=
	// setting (see below).
	User systemdconf.Value

	// Set the UNIX user or group that the processes are executed as, respectively. Takes a single user or group name, or a numeric

	// If the User= setting is used the supplementary group list is initialized from the specified user's default group list,
	// as defined in the system's user and group database. Additional groups may be configured through the SupplementaryGroups=
	// setting (see below).
	Group systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean parameter. If set, a UNIX user and group pair is allocated dynamically when the unit is started, and released
	// as soon as it is stopped. The user and group will not be added to /etc/passwd or /etc/group, but are managed transiently during
	// runtime. The nss-systemd glibc NSS module provides integration of these dynamic users/groups into the system's user
	// and group databases. The user and group name to use may be configured via User= and Group= (see above). If these options are
	// not used and dynamic user/group allocation is enabled for a unit, the name of the dynamic user/group is implicitly derived
	// from the unit name. If the unit name without the type suffix qualifies as valid user name it is used directly, otherwise a
	// name incorporating a hash of it is used. If a statically allocated user or group of the configured name already exists, it
	// is used and no dynamic user/group is allocated. Note that if User= is specified and the static group with the name exists,
	// then it is required that the static user with the name already exists. Similarly, if Group= is specified and the static user
	// with the name exists, then it is required that the static group with the name already exists. Dynamic users/groups are allocated
	// from the UID/GID range 61184â€¦65519. It is recommended to avoid this range for regular system or login users. At any point
	// in time each UID/GID from this range is only assigned to zero or one dynamically allocated users/groups in use. However,
	// UID/GIDs are recycled after a unit is terminated. Care should be taken that any processes running as part of a unit for which
	// dynamic users/groups are enabled do not leave files or directories owned by these users/groups around, as a different
	// unit might get the same UID/GID assigned later on, and thus gain access to these files or directories. If DynamicUser= is
	// enabled, RemoveIPC= and PrivateTmp= are implied (and cannot be turned off). This ensures that the lifetime of IPC objects
	// and temporary files created by the executed processes is bound to the runtime of the service, and hence the lifetime of the
	// dynamic user/group. Since /tmp/ and /var/tmp/ are usually the only world-writable directories on a system this ensures
	// that a unit making use of dynamic user/group allocation cannot leave files around after unit termination. Furthermore
	// NoNewPrivileges= and RestrictSUIDSGID= are implicitly enabled (and cannot be disabled), to ensure that processes invoked
	// cannot take benefit or create SUID/SGID files or directories. Moreover ProtectSystem=strict and ProtectHome=read-only
	// are implied, thus prohibiting the service to write to arbitrary file system locations. In order to allow the service to
	// write to certain directories, they have to be allow-listed using ReadWritePaths=, but care must be taken so that UID/GID
	// recycling doesn't create security issues involving files created by the service. Use RuntimeDirectory= (see below)
	// in order to assign a writable runtime directory to a service, owned by the dynamic user/group and removed automatically
	// when the unit is terminated. Use StateDirectory=, CacheDirectory= and LogsDirectory= in order to assign a set of writable
	// directories for specific purposes to the service in a way that they are protected from vulnerabilities due to UID reuse
	// (see below). If this option is enabled, care should be taken that the unit's processes do not get access to directories outside
	// of these explicitly configured and managed ones. Specifically, do not use BindPaths= and be careful with AF_UNIX file
	// descriptor passing for directory file descriptors, as this would permit processes to create files or directories owned
	// by the dynamic user/group that are not subject to the lifecycle and access guarantees of the service. Defaults to off.
	DynamicUser systemdconf.Value

	// Sets the supplementary Unix groups the processes are executed as. This takes a space-separated list of group names or IDs.
	// This option may be specified more than once, in which case all listed groups are set as supplementary groups. When the empty
	// string is assigned, the list of supplementary groups is reset, and all assignments prior to this one will have no effect.
	// In any way, this option does not override, but extends the list of supplementary groups configured in the system group database
	// for the user. This does not affect commands prefixed with "+".
	SupplementaryGroups systemdconf.Value

	// Sets the PAM service name to set up a session as. If set, the executed process will be registered as a PAM session under the
	// specified service name. This is only useful in conjunction with the User= setting, and is otherwise ignored. If not set,
	// no PAM session will be opened for the executed processes. See pam for details.
	//
	// Note that for each unit making use of this option a PAM session handler process will be maintained as part of the unit and stays
	// around as long as the unit is active, to ensure that appropriate actions can be taken when the unit and hence the PAM session
	// terminates. This process is named "(sd-pam)" and is an immediate child process of the unit's main process.
	//
	// Note that when this option is used for a unit it is very likely (depending on PAM configuration) that the main unit process
	// will be migrated to its own session scope unit when it is activated. This process will hence be associated with two units:
	// the unit it was originally started from (and for which PAMName= was configured), and the session scope unit. Any child processes
	// of that process will however be associated with the session scope unit only. This has implications when used in combination
	// with NotifyAccess=all, as these child processes will not be able to affect changes in the original unit through notification
	// messages. These messages will be considered belonging to the session scope unit and not the original unit. It is hence not
	// recommended to use PAMName= in combination with NotifyAccess=all.
	PAMName systemdconf.Value

	// Controls which capabilities to include in the capability bounding set for the executed process. See capabilities for
	// details. Takes a whitespace-separated list of capability names, e.g. CAP_SYS_ADMIN, CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE, CAP_SYS_PTRACE.
	// Capabilities listed will be included in the bounding set, all others are removed. If the list of capabilities is prefixed
	// with "~", all but the listed capabilities will be included, the effect of the assignment inverted. Note that this option
	// also affects the respective capabilities in the effective, permitted and inheritable capability sets. If this option
	// is not used, the capability bounding set is not modified on process execution, hence no limits on the capabilities of the
	// process are enforced. This option may appear more than once, in which case the bounding sets are merged by OR, or by AND if
	// the lines are prefixed with "~" (see below). If the empty string is assigned to this option, the bounding set is reset to the
	// empty capability set, and all prior settings have no effect. If set to "~" (without any further argument), the bounding
	// set is reset to the full set of available capabilities, also undoing any previous settings. This does not affect commands
	// prefixed with "+".
	//
	// Use systemd-analyze's capability command to retrieve a list of capabilities defined on the local system.
	//
	// Example: if a unit has the following,
	//
	// 	CapabilityBoundingSet=CAP_A CAP_B CapabilityBoundingSet=CAP_B CAP_C
	//
	// then CAP_A, CAP_B, and CAP_C are set. If the second line is prefixed with "~", e.g.,
	//
	// 	CapabilityBoundingSet=CAP_A CAP_B CapabilityBoundingSet=~CAP_B CAP_C
	//
	// then, only CAP_A is set.
	CapabilityBoundingSet systemdconf.Value

	// Controls which capabilities to include in the ambient capability set for the executed process. Takes a whitespace-separated

	// Controls the secure bits set for the executed process. Takes a space-separated combination of options from the following

	// Set soft and hard limits on various resources for executed processes. See setrlimit for details on the resource limit concept.
	// Resource limits may be specified in two formats: either as single value to set a specific soft and hard limit to the same value,
	// or as colon-separated pair soft:hard to set both limits individually (e.g. "LimitAS=4G:16G"). Use the string infinity
	// to configure no limit on a specific resource. The multiplicative suffixes K, M, G, T, P and E (to the base 1024) may be used
	// for resource limits measured in bytes (e.g. "LimitAS=16G"). For the limits referring to time values, the usual time units
	// ms, s, min, h and so on may be used (see systemd.time for details). Note that if no time unit is specified for LimitCPU= the
	// default unit of seconds is implied, while for LimitRTTIME= the default unit of microseconds is implied. Also, note that
	// the effective granularity of the limits might influence their enforcement. For example, time limits specified for LimitCPU=
	// will be rounded up implicitly to multiples of 1s. For LimitNICE= the value may be specified in two syntaxes: if prefixed
	// with "+" or "-", the value is understood as regular Linux nice value in the range -20..19. If not prefixed like this the value
	// is understood as raw resource limit parameter in the range 0..40 (with 0 being equivalent to 1).
	//
	// Note that most process resource limits configured with these options are per-process, and processes may fork in order
	// to acquire a new set of resources that are accounted independently of the original process, and may thus escape limits set.
	// Also note that LimitRSS= is not implemented on Linux, and setting it has no effect. Often it is advisable to prefer the resource
	// controls listed in systemd.resource-control over these per-process limits, as they apply to services as a whole, may
	// be altered dynamically at runtime, and are generally more expressive. For example, MemoryMax= is a more powerful (and
	// working) replacement for LimitRSS=.
	//
	// Resource limits not configured explicitly for a unit default to the value configured in the various DefaultLimitCPU=,

	// For system units these resource limits may be chosen freely. When these settings are configured in a user service (i.e.

	// In user context these configuration options are hence only useful to lower the limits passed in or to raise the soft limit

	// Controls how the kernel session keyring is set up for the service (see session-keyring for details on the session keyring).
	// Takes one of inherit, private, shared. If set to inherit no special keyring setup is done, and the kernel's default behaviour
	// is applied. If private is used a new session keyring is allocated when a service process is invoked, and it is not linked up
	// with any user keyring. This is the recommended setting for system services, as this ensures that multiple services running

	// under the same user ID may share key material. Unless inherit is selected the unique invocation ID for the unit (see below)
	// is added as a protected key by the name "invocation_id" to the newly created session keyring. Defaults to private for services

	// depends on the system architecture. Usually the 64bit versions of the various system architectures support their immediate

	CPUSchedulingResetOnFork systemdconf.Value

	// Controls the CPU affinity of the executed processes. Takes a list of CPU indices or ranges separated by either whitespace

	// and IOSchedulingPriority= have no effect. See ioprio_set for details.
	IOSchedulingClass systemdconf.Value

	// Sets the I/O scheduling priority for executed processes. Takes an integer between 0 (highest priority) and 7 (lowest priority).

	// option, all prior assignments to both IOSchedulingClass= and IOSchedulingPriority= have no effect. See ioprio_set
	// for details.
	IOSchedulingPriority systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument or the special values "full" or "strict". If true, mounts the /usr/ and the boot loader directories
	// (/boot and /efi) read-only for processes invoked by this unit. If set to "full", the /etc/ directory is mounted read-only,
	// too. If set to "strict" the entire file system hierarchy is mounted read-only, except for the API file system subtrees /dev/,
	// /proc/ and /sys/ (protect these directories using PrivateDevices=, ProtectKernelTunables=, ProtectControlGroups=).
	// This setting ensures that any modification of the vendor-supplied operating system (and optionally its configuration,
	// and local mounts) is prohibited for the service. It is recommended to enable this setting for all long-running services,
	// unless they are involved with system updates or need to modify the operating system in other ways. If this option is used,
	// ReadWritePaths= may be used to exclude specific directories from being made read-only. This setting is implied if DynamicUser=
	// is set. This setting cannot ensure protection in all cases. In general it has the same limitations as ReadOnlyPaths=, see
	// below. Defaults to off.
	ProtectSystem systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument or the special values "read-only" or "tmpfs". If true, the directories /home/, /root, and /run/user
	// are made inaccessible and empty for processes invoked by this unit. If set to "read-only", the three directories are made
	// read-only instead. If set to "tmpfs", temporary file systems are mounted on the three directories in read-only mode. The
	// value "tmpfs" is useful to hide home directories not relevant to the processes invoked by the unit, while still allowing
	// necessary directories to be made visible when listed in BindPaths= or BindReadOnlyPaths=.
	//
	// Setting this to "yes" is mostly equivalent to set the three directories in InaccessiblePaths=. Similarly, "read-only"
	// is mostly equivalent to ReadOnlyPaths=, and "tmpfs" is mostly equivalent to TemporaryFileSystem= with ":ro".
	//
	// It is recommended to enable this setting for all long-running services (in particular network-facing ones), to ensure

	ConfigurationDirectoryMode systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument or restart. If set to no (the default), the directories specified in RuntimeDirectory= are always
	// removed when the service stops. If set to restart the directories are preserved when the service is both automatically
	// and manually restarted. Here, the automatic restart means the operation specified in Restart=, and manual restart means
	// the one triggered by systemctl restart foo.service. If set to yes, then the directories are not removed when the service
	// is stopped. Note that since the runtime directory /run/ is a mount point of "tmpfs", then for system services the directories
	// specified in RuntimeDirectory= are removed when the system is rebooted.
	RuntimeDirectoryPreserve systemdconf.Value

	// Configures a timeout on the clean-up operation requested through systemctl clean â€¦, see systemctl for details. Takes

	InaccessiblePaths systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a space-separated list of mount points for temporary file systems (tmpfs). If set, a new file system namespace is
	// set up for executed processes, and a temporary file system is mounted on each mount point. This option may be specified more
	// than once, in which case temporary file systems are mounted on all listed mount points. If the empty string is assigned to

	// These can be disabled by explicitly specifying the corresponding mount options, e.g., "dev" or "nostrictatime".
	//
	// This is useful to hide files or directories not relevant to the processes invoked by the unit, while necessary files or directories

	//
	// This option is only available for system services and is not supported for services running in per-user instances of the
	// service manager.
	TemporaryFileSystem systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. If true, sets up a new file system namespace for the executed processes and mounts private /tmp/
	// and /var/tmp/ directories inside it that are not shared by processes outside of the namespace. This is useful to secure
	// access to temporary files of the process, but makes sharing between processes via /tmp/ or /var/tmp/ impossible. If this
	// is enabled, all temporary files created by a service in these directories will be removed after the service is stopped.
	// Defaults to false. It is possible to run two or more units within the same private /tmp/ and /var/tmp/ namespace by using
	// the JoinsNamespaceOf= directive, see systemd.unit for details. This setting is implied if DynamicUser= is set. For this
	// setting the same restrictions regarding mount propagation and privileges apply as for ReadOnlyPaths= and related calls,
	// see above. Enabling this setting has the side effect of adding Requires= and After= dependencies on all mount units necessary
	// to access /tmp/ and /var/tmp/. Moreover an implicitly After= ordering on systemd-tmpfiles-setup.service is added.
	//
	// Note that the implementation of this setting might be impossible (for example if mount namespaces are not available),
	// and the unit should be written in a way that does not solely rely on this setting for security.
	//
	// This option is only available for system services and is not supported for services running in per-user instances of the
	// service manager.
	PrivateTmp systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. If true, sets up a new /dev/ mount for the executed processes and only adds API pseudo devices such
	// as /dev/null, /dev/zero or /dev/random (as well as the pseudo TTY subsystem) to it, but no physical devices such as /dev/sda,
	// system memory /dev/mem, system ports /dev/port and others. This is useful to securely turn off physical device access
	// by the executed process. Defaults to false. Enabling this option will install a system call filter to block low-level I/O
	// system calls that are grouped in the @raw-io set, will also remove CAP_MKNOD and CAP_SYS_RAWIO from the capability bounding
	// set for the unit (see above), and set DevicePolicy=closed (see systemd.resource-control for details). Note that using
	// this setting will disconnect propagation of mounts from the service to the host (propagation in the opposite direction
	// continues to work). This means that this setting may not be used for services which shall be able to install mount points
	// in the main mount namespace. The new /dev/ will be mounted read-only and 'noexec'. The latter may break old programs which
	// try to set up executable memory by using mmap of /dev/zero instead of using MAP_ANON. For this setting the same restrictions
	// regarding mount propagation and privileges apply as for ReadOnlyPaths= and related calls, see above. If turned on and
	// if running in user mode, or in system mode, but without the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (e.g. setting User=), NoNewPrivileges=yes
	// is implied.
	//
	// Note that the implementation of this setting might be impossible (for example if mount namespaces are not available),

	//
	// This option is only available for system services and is not supported for services running in per-user instances of the

	PrivateDevices systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. If true, sets up a new network namespace for the executed processes and configures only the loopback
	// network device "lo" inside it. No other network devices will be available to the executed process. This is useful to turn
	// off network access by the executed process. Defaults to false. It is possible to run two or more units within the same private
	// network namespace by using the JoinsNamespaceOf= directive, see systemd.unit for details. Note that this option will
	// disconnect all socket families from the host, including AF_NETLINK and AF_UNIX. Effectively, for AF_NETLINK this means
	// that device configuration events received from systemd-udevd.service are not delivered to the unit's processes. And
	// for AF_UNIX this has the effect that AF_UNIX sockets in the abstract socket namespace of the host will become unavailable
	// to the unit's processes (however, those located in the file system will continue to be accessible).
	//
	// Note that the implementation of this setting might be impossible (for example if network namespaces are not available),
	// and the unit should be written in a way that does not solely rely on this setting for security.
	//
	// When this option is used on a socket unit any sockets bound on behalf of this unit will be bound within a private network namespace.
	// This may be combined with JoinsNamespaceOf= to listen on sockets inside of network namespaces of other services.
	//
	// This option is only available for system services and is not supported for services running in per-user instances of the
	// service manager.
	PrivateNetwork systemdconf.Value

	// Takes an absolute file system path refererring to a Linux network namespace pseudo-file (i.e. a file like /proc/$PID/ns/net
	// or a bind mount or symlink to one). When set the invoked processes are added to the network namespace referenced by that path.
	// The path has to point to a valid namespace file at the moment the processes are forked off. If this option is used PrivateNetwork=
	// has no effect. If this option is used together with JoinsNamespaceOf= then it only has an effect if this unit is started before
	// any of the listed units that have PrivateNetwork= or NetworkNamespacePath= configured, as otherwise the network namespace
	// of those units is reused.
	//
	// When this option is used on a socket unit any sockets bound on behalf of this unit will be bound within the specified network
	// namespace.
	//
	// This option is only available for system services and is not supported for services running in per-user instances of the
	// service manager.
	NetworkNamespacePath systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. If true, sets up a new user namespace for the executed processes and configures a minimal user
	// and group mapping, that maps the "root" user and group as well as the unit's own user and group to themselves and everything
	// else to the "nobody" user and group. This is useful to securely detach the user and group databases used by the unit from the
	// rest of the system, and thus to create an effective sandbox environment. All files, directories, processes, IPC objects
	// and other resources owned by users/groups not equaling "root" or the unit's own will stay visible from within the unit but
	// appear owned by the "nobody" user and group. If this mode is enabled, all unit processes are run without privileges in the
	// host user namespace (regardless if the unit's own user/group is "root" or not). Specifically this means that the process
	// will have zero process capabilities on the host's user namespace, but full capabilities within the service's user namespace.
	// Settings such as CapabilityBoundingSet= will affect only the latter, and there's no way to acquire additional capabilities
	// in the host's user namespace. Defaults to off.
	//
	// When this setting is set up by a per-user instance of the service manager, the mapping of the "root" user and group to itself
	// is omitted (unless the user manager is root). Additionally, in the per-user instance manager case, the user namespace
	// will be set up before most other namespaces. This means that combining PrivateUsers=true with other namespaces will enable
	// use of features not normally supported by the per-user instances of the service manager.
	//
	// This setting is particularly useful in conjunction with RootDirectory=/RootImage=, as the need to synchronize the user
	// and group databases in the root directory and on the host is reduced, as the only users and groups who need to be matched are
	// "root", "nobody" and the unit's own user and group.
	//
	// Note that the implementation of this setting might be impossible (for example if user namespaces are not available), and
	// the unit should be written in a way that does not solely rely on this setting for security.
	PrivateUsers systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. When set, sets up a new UTS namespace for the executed processes. In addition, changing hostname
	// or domainname is prevented. Defaults to off.
	//
	// Note that the implementation of this setting might be impossible (for example if UTS namespaces are not available), and
	// the unit should be written in a way that does not solely rely on this setting for security.
	//
	// Note that when this option is enabled for a service hostname changes no longer propagate from the system into the service,
	// it is hence not suitable for services that need to take notice of system hostname changes dynamically.
	//
	// This option is only available for system services and is not supported for services running in per-user instances of the
	// service manager.
	ProtectHostname systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. If set, writes to the hardware clock or system clock will be denied. It is recommended to turn this
	// on for most services that do not need modify the clock. Defaults to off. Enabling this option removes CAP_SYS_TIME and CAP_WAKE_ALARM
	// from the capability bounding set for this unit, installs a system call filter to block calls that can set the clock, and DeviceAllow=char-rtc
	// r is implied. This ensures /dev/rtc0, /dev/rtc1, etc. are made read-only to the service. See systemd.resource-control
	// for the details about DeviceAllow=.
	//
	// This option is only available for system services and is not supported for services running in per-user instances of the
	// service manager.
	ProtectClock systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. If true, kernel variables accessible through /proc/sys/, /sys/, /proc/sysrq-trigger, /proc/latency_stats,
	// /proc/acpi, /proc/timer_stats, /proc/fs and /proc/irq will be made read-only to all processes of the unit. Usually,
	// tunable kernel variables should be initialized only at boot-time, for example with the sysctl.d mechanism. Few services
	// need to write to these at runtime; it is hence recommended to turn this on for most services. For this setting the same restrictions
	// regarding mount propagation and privileges apply as for ReadOnlyPaths= and related calls, see above. Defaults to off.
	// If turned on and if running in user mode, or in system mode, but without the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (e.g. services for
	// which User= is set), NoNewPrivileges=yes is implied. Note that this option does not prevent indirect changes to kernel
	// tunables effected by IPC calls to other processes. However, InaccessiblePaths= may be used to make relevant IPC file system
	// objects inaccessible. If ProtectKernelTunables= is set, MountAPIVFS=yes is implied.
	//
	// This option is only available for system services and is not supported for services running in per-user instances of the
	// service manager.
	ProtectKernelTunables systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. If true, explicit module loading will be denied. This allows module load and unload operations
	// to be turned off on modular kernels. It is recommended to turn this on for most services that do not need special file systems
	// or extra kernel modules to work. Defaults to off. Enabling this option removes CAP_SYS_MODULE from the capability bounding
	// set for the unit, and installs a system call filter to block module system calls, also /usr/lib/modules is made inaccessible.
	// For this setting the same restrictions regarding mount propagation and privileges apply as for ReadOnlyPaths= and related
	// calls, see above. Note that limited automatic module loading due to user configuration or kernel mapping tables might
	// still happen as side effect of requested user operations, both privileged and unprivileged. To disable module auto-load
	// feature please see sysctl.d kernel.modules_disabled mechanism and /proc/sys/kernel/modules_disabled documentation.
	// If turned on and if running in user mode, or in system mode, but without the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (e.g. setting User=),
	// NoNewPrivileges=yes is implied.
	//
	// This option is only available for system services and is not supported for services running in per-user instances of the
	// service manager.
	ProtectKernelModules systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. If true, access to the kernel log ring buffer will be denied. It is recommended to turn this on for
	// most services that do not need to read from or write to the kernel log ring buffer. Enabling this option removes CAP_SYSLOG
	// from the capability bounding set for this unit, and installs a system call filter to block the syslog system call (not to
	// be confused with the libc API syslog for userspace logging). The kernel exposes its log buffer to userspace via /dev/kmsg
	// and /proc/kmsg. If enabled, these are made inaccessible to all the processes in the unit.
	//
	// This option is only available for system services and is not supported for services running in per-user instances of the
	// service manager.
	ProtectKernelLogs systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. If true, the Linux Control Groups (cgroups) hierarchies accessible through /sys/fs/cgroup/
	// will be made read-only to all processes of the unit. Except for container managers no services should require write access
	// to the control groups hierarchies; it is hence recommended to turn this on for most services. For this setting the same restrictions
	// regarding mount propagation and privileges apply as for ReadOnlyPaths= and related calls, see above. Defaults to off.
	// If ProtectControlGroups= is set, MountAPIVFS=yes is implied.
	//
	// This option is only available for system services and is not supported for services running in per-user instances of the
	// service manager.
	ProtectControlGroups systemdconf.Value

	// Restricts the set of socket address families accessible to the processes of this unit. Takes a space-separated list of
	// address family names to allow-list, such as AF_UNIX, AF_INET or AF_INET6. When prefixed with ~ the listed address families
	// will be applied as deny list, otherwise as allow list. Note that this restricts access to the socket system call only. Sockets
	// passed into the process by other means (for example, by using socket activation with socket units, see systemd.socket)
	// are unaffected. Also, sockets created with socketpair() (which creates connected AF_UNIX sockets only) are unaffected.
	// Note that this option has no effect on 32-bit x86, s390, s390x, mips, mips-le, ppc, ppc-le, ppc64, ppc64-le and is ignored
	// (but works correctly on other ABIs, including x86-64). Note that on systems supporting multiple ABIs (such as x86/x86-64)
	// it is recommended to turn off alternative ABIs for services, so that they cannot be used to circumvent the restrictions
	// of this option. Specifically, it is recommended to combine this option with SystemCallArchitectures=native or similar.
	// If running in user mode, or in system mode, but without the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (e.g. setting User=nobody), NoNewPrivileges=yes
	// is implied. By default, no restrictions apply, all address families are accessible to processes. If assigned the empty
	// string, any previous address family restriction changes are undone. This setting does not affect commands prefixed with
	// "+".
	//
	// Use this option to limit exposure of processes to remote access, in particular via exotic and sensitive network protocols,
	// such as AF_PACKET. Note that in most cases, the local AF_UNIX address family should be included in the configured allow
	// list as it is frequently used for local communication, including for syslog logging.
	RestrictAddressFamilies systemdconf.Value

	// Restricts access to Linux namespace functionality for the processes of this unit. For details about Linux namespaces,
	// see namespaces. Either takes a boolean argument, or a space-separated list of namespace type identifiers. If false (the
	// default), no restrictions on namespace creation and switching are made. If true, access to any kind of namespacing is prohibited.
	// Otherwise, a space-separated list of namespace type identifiers must be specified, consisting of any combination of:
	// cgroup, ipc, net, mnt, pid, user and uts. Any namespace type listed is made accessible to the unit's processes, access to
	// namespace types not listed is prohibited (allow-listing). By prepending the list with a single tilde character ("~")
	// the effect may be inverted: only the listed namespace types will be made inaccessible, all unlisted ones are permitted
	// (deny-listing). If the empty string is assigned, the default namespace restrictions are applied, which is equivalent
	// to false. This option may appear more than once, in which case the namespace types are merged by OR, or by AND if the lines are
	// prefixed with "~" (see examples below). Internally, this setting limits access to the unshare, clone and setns system
	// calls, taking the specified flags parameters into account. Note that â€” if this option is used â€” in addition to restricting
	// creation and switching of the specified types of namespaces (or all of them, if true) access to the setns() system call with

	// mips64-n32, mips64-le-n32, ppc64, ppc64-le, s390 and s390x, and enforces no restrictions on other architectures. If
	// running in user mode, or in system mode, but without the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (e.g. setting User=), NoNewPrivileges=yes
	// is implied.
	//
	// Example: if a unit has the following,

	RestrictNamespaces systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. If set, locks down the personality system call so that the kernel execution domain may not be changed
	// from the default or the personality selected with Personality= directive. This may be useful to improve security, because
	// odd personality emulations may be poorly tested and source of vulnerabilities. If running in user mode, or in system mode,
	// but without the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (e.g. setting User=), NoNewPrivileges=yes is implied.
	LockPersonality systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. If set, attempts to create memory mappings that are writable and executable at the same time,
	// or to change existing memory mappings to become executable, or mapping shared memory segments as executable are prohibited.
	// Specifically, a system call filter is added that rejects mmap system calls with both PROT_EXEC and PROT_WRITE set, mprotect
	// or pkey_mprotect system calls with PROT_EXEC set and shmat system calls with SHM_EXEC set. Note that this option is incompatible
	// with programs and libraries that generate program code dynamically at runtime, including JIT execution engines, executable
	// stacks, and code "trampoline" feature of various C compilers. This option improves service security, as it makes harder
	// for software exploits to change running code dynamically. However, the protection can be circumvented, if the service
	// can write to a filesystem, which is not mounted with noexec (such as /dev/shm), or it can use memfd_create(). This can be
	// prevented by making such file systems inaccessible to the service (e.g. InaccessiblePaths=/dev/shm) and installing
	// further system call filters (SystemCallFilter=~memfd_create). Note that this feature is fully available on x86-64,
	// and partially on x86. Specifically, the shmat() protection is not available on x86. Note that on systems supporting multiple
	// ABIs (such as x86/x86-64) it is recommended to turn off alternative ABIs for services, so that they cannot be used to circumvent
	// the restrictions of this option. Specifically, it is recommended to combine this option with SystemCallArchitectures=native
	// or similar. If running in user mode, or in system mode, but without the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (e.g. setting User=),
	// NoNewPrivileges=yes is implied.
	MemoryDenyWriteExecute systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. If set, any attempts to enable realtime scheduling in a process of the unit are refused. This restricts
	// access to realtime task scheduling policies such as SCHED_FIFO, SCHED_RR or SCHED_DEADLINE. See sched for details about
	// these scheduling policies. If running in user mode, or in system mode, but without the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (e.g.
	// setting User=), NoNewPrivileges=yes is implied. Realtime scheduling policies may be used to monopolize CPU time for
	// longer periods of time, and may hence be used to lock up or otherwise trigger Denial-of-Service situations on the system.
	// It is hence recommended to restrict access to realtime scheduling to the few programs that actually require them. Defaults
	// to off.
	RestrictRealtime systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. If set, any attempts to set the set-user-ID (SUID) or set-group-ID (SGID) bits on files or directories
	// will be denied (for details on these bits see inode). If running in user mode, or in system mode, but without the CAP_SYS_ADMIN
	// capability (e.g. setting User=), NoNewPrivileges=yes is implied. As the SUID/SGID bits are mechanisms to elevate privileges,
	// and allows users to acquire the identity of other users, it is recommended to restrict creation of SUID/SGID files to the
	// few programs that actually require them. Note that this restricts marking of any type of file system object with these bits,
	// including both regular files and directories (where the SGID is a different meaning than for files, see documentation).
	// This option is implied if DynamicUser= is enabled. Defaults to off.
	RestrictSUIDSGID systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean parameter. If set, all System V and POSIX IPC objects owned by the user and group the processes of this unit
	// are run as are removed when the unit is stopped. This setting only has an effect if at least one of User=, Group= and DynamicUser=
	// are used. It has no effect on IPC objects owned by the root user. Specifically, this removes System V semaphores, as well
	// as System V and POSIX shared memory segments and message queues. If multiple units use the same user or group the IPC objects
	// are removed when the last of these units is stopped. This setting is implied if DynamicUser= is set.
	//
	// This option is only available for system services and is not supported for services running in per-user instances of the
	// service manager.
	RemoveIPC systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean parameter. If set, the processes of this unit will be run in their own private file system (mount) namespace
	// with all mount propagation from the processes towards the host's main file system namespace turned off. This means any
	// file system mount points established or removed by the unit's processes will be private to them and not be visible to the
	// host. However, file system mount points established or removed on the host will be propagated to the unit's processes.
	// See mount_namespaces for details on file system namespaces. Defaults to off.
	//
	// When turned on, this executes three operations for each invoked process: a new CLONE_NEWNS namespace is created, after
	// which all existing mounts are remounted to MS_SLAVE to disable propagation from the unit's processes to the host (but leaving
	// propagation in the opposite direction in effect). Finally, the mounts are remounted again to the propagation mode configured
	// with MountFlags=, see below.
	//
	// File system namespaces are set up individually for each process forked off by the service manager. Mounts established
	// in the namespace of the process created by ExecStartPre= will hence be cleaned up automatically as soon as that process
	// exits and will not be available to subsequent processes forked off for ExecStart= (and similar applies to the various other
	// commands configured for units). Similarly, JoinsNamespaceOf= does not permit sharing kernel mount namespaces between
	// units, it only enables sharing of the /tmp/ and /var/tmp/ directories.
	//
	// Other file system namespace unit settings â€” PrivateMounts=, PrivateTmp=, PrivateDevices=, ProtectSystem=, ProtectHome=,
	// ReadOnlyPaths=, InaccessiblePaths=, ReadWritePaths=, â€¦ â€” also enable file system namespacing in a fashion equivalent
	// to this option. Hence it is primarily useful to explicitly request this behaviour if none of the other settings are used.
	//
	// This option is only available for system services and is not supported for services running in per-user instances of the
	// service manager.
	PrivateMounts systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a mount propagation setting: shared, slave or private, which controls whether file system mount points in the file
	// system namespaces set up for this unit's processes will receive or propagate mounts and unmounts from other file system
	// namespaces. See mount for details on mount propagation, and the three propagation flags in particular.
	//
	// This setting only controls the final propagation setting in effect on all mount points of the file system namespace created
	// for each process of this unit. Other file system namespacing unit settings (see the discussion in PrivateMounts= above)
	// will implicitly disable mount and unmount propagation from the unit's processes towards the host by changing the propagation
	// setting of all mount points in the unit's file system namespace to slave first. Setting this option to shared does not reestablish
	// propagation in that case.
	//
	// If not set â€“ but file system namespaces are enabled through another file system namespace unit setting â€“ shared mount propagation
	// is used, but â€” as mentioned â€” as slave is applied first, propagation from the unit's processes to the host is still turned
	// off.
	//
	// It is not recommended to use private mount propagation for units, as this means temporary mounts (such as removable media)
	// of the host will stay mounted and thus indefinitely busy in forked off processes, as unmount propagation events won't be
	// received by the file system namespace of the unit.
	//
	// Usually, it is best to leave this setting unmodified, and use higher level file system namespacing options instead, in
	// particular PrivateMounts=, see above.
	//
	// This option is only available for system services and is not supported for services running in per-user instances of the
	// service manager.
	MountFlags systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a space-separated list of system call names. If this setting is used, all system calls executed by the unit processes
	// except for the listed ones will result in immediate process termination with the SIGSYS signal (allow-listing). (See
	// SystemCallErrorNumber= below for changing the default action). If the first character of the list is "~", the effect is
	// inverted: only the listed system calls will result in immediate process termination (deny-listing). Deny-listed system
	// calls and system call groups may optionally be suffixed with a colon (":") and "errno" error number (between 0 and 4095)
	// or errno name such as EPERM, EACCES or EUCLEAN (see errno for a full list). This value will be returned when a deny-listed
	// system call is triggered, instead of terminating the processes immediately. Special setting "kill" can be used to explicitly
	// specify killing. This value takes precedence over the one given in SystemCallErrorNumber=, see below. If running in user
	// mode, or in system mode, but without the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (e.g. setting User=nobody), NoNewPrivileges=yes
	// is implied. This feature makes use of the Secure Computing Mode 2 interfaces of the kernel ('seccomp filtering') and is
	// useful for enforcing a minimal sandboxing environment. Note that the execve(), exit(), exit_group(), getrlimit(),
	// rt_sigreturn(), sigreturn() system calls and the system calls for querying time and sleeping are implicitly allow-listed
	// and do not need to be listed explicitly. This option may be specified more than once, in which case the filter masks are merged.
	// If the empty string is assigned, the filter is reset, all prior assignments will have no effect. This does not affect commands
	// prefixed with "+".
	//
	// Note that on systems supporting multiple ABIs (such as x86/x86-64) it is recommended to turn off alternative ABIs for services,
	// so that they cannot be used to circumvent the restrictions of this option. Specifically, it is recommended to combine this
	// option with SystemCallArchitectures=native or similar.
	//
	// Note that strict system call filters may impact execution and error handling code paths of the service invocation. Specifically,
	// access to the execve() system call is required for the execution of the service binary â€” if it is blocked service invocation
	// will necessarily fail. Also, if execution of the service binary fails for some reason (for example: missing service executable),
	// the error handling logic might require access to an additional set of system calls in order to process and log this failure
	// correctly. It might be necessary to temporarily disable system call filters in order to simplify debugging of such failures.
	//
	// If you specify both types of this option (i.e. allow-listing and deny-listing), the first encountered will take precedence
	// and will dictate the default action (termination or approval of a system call). Then the next occurrences of this option
	// will add or delete the listed system calls from the set of the filtered system calls, depending of its type and the default
	// action. (For example, if you have started with an allow list rule for read() and write(), and right after it add a deny list
	// rule for write(), then write() will be removed from the set.)
	//
	// As the number of possible system calls is large, predefined sets of system calls are provided. A set starts with "@" character,
	// followed by name of the set.

	// 	+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
	//
	// Note, that as new system calls are added to the kernel, additional system calls might be added to the groups above. Contents
	// of the sets may also change between systemd versions. In addition, the list of system calls depends on the kernel version
	// and architecture for which systemd was compiled. Use systemd-analyzeÂ syscall-filter to list the actual list of system
	// calls in each filter.
	//
	// Generally, allow-listing system calls (rather than deny-listing) is the safer mode of operation. It is recommended to
	// enforce system call allow lists for all long-running system services. Specifically, the following lines are a relatively
	// safe basic choice for the majority of system services:
	//
	// 	[Service] SystemCallFilter=@system-service SystemCallErrorNumber=EPERM
	//
	// Note that various kernel system calls are defined redundantly: there are multiple system calls for executing the same
	// operation. For example, the pidfd_send_signal() system call may be used to execute operations similar to what can be done
	// with the older kill() system call, hence blocking the latter without the former only provides weak protection. Since new
	// system calls are added regularly to the kernel as development progresses, keeping system call deny lists comprehensive
	// requires constant work. It is thus recommended to use allow-listing instead, which offers the benefit that new system
	// calls are by default implicitly blocked until the allow list is updated.
	//
	// Also note that a number of system calls are required to be accessible for the dynamic linker to work. The dynamic linker is
	// required for running most regular programs (specifically: all dynamic ELF binaries, which is how most distributions
	// build packaged programs). This means that blocking these system calls (which include open(), openat() or mmap()) will
	// make most programs typically shipped with generic distributions unusable.
	//
	// It is recommended to combine the file system namespacing related options with SystemCallFilter=~@mount, in order to
	// prohibit the unit's processes to undo the mappings. Specifically these are the options PrivateTmp=, PrivateDevices=,
	// ProtectSystem=, ProtectHome=, ProtectKernelTunables=, ProtectControlGroups=, ProtectKernelLogs=, ProtectClock=,
	// ReadOnlyPaths=, InaccessiblePaths= and ReadWritePaths=.
	SystemCallFilter systemdconf.Value

	// Takes an "errno" error number (between 1 and 4095) or errno name such as EPERM, EACCES or EUCLEAN, to return when the system
	// call filter configured with SystemCallFilter= is triggered, instead of terminating the process immediately. See errno
	// for a full list of error codes. When this setting is not used, or when the empty string or the special setting "kill" is assigned,
	// the process will be terminated immediately when the filter is triggered.
	SystemCallErrorNumber systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a space-separated list of architecture identifiers to include in the system call filter. The known architecture
	// identifiers are the same as for ConditionArchitecture= described in systemd.unit, as well as x32, mips64-n32, mips64-le-n32,
	// and the special identifier native. The special identifier native implicitly maps to the native architecture of the system
	// (or more precisely: to the architecture the system manager is compiled for). If running in user mode, or in system mode,
	// but without the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (e.g. setting User=nobody), NoNewPrivileges=yes is implied. By default,
	// this option is set to the empty list, i.e. no filtering is applied.
	//
	// If this setting is used, processes of this unit will only be permitted to call native system calls, and system calls of the
	// specified architectures. For the purposes of this option, the x32 architecture is treated as including x86-64 system
	// calls. However, this setting still fulfills its purpose, as explained below, on x32.
	//
	// System call filtering is not equally effective on all architectures. For example, on x86 filtering of network socket-related
	// calls is not possible, due to ABI limitations â€” a limitation that x86-64 does not have, however. On systems supporting multiple
	// ABIs at the same time â€” such as x86/x86-64 â€” it is hence recommended to limit the set of permitted system call architectures
	// so that secondary ABIs may not be used to circumvent the restrictions applied to the native ABI of the system. In particular,
	// setting SystemCallArchitectures=native is a good choice for disabling non-native ABIs.
	//
	// System call architectures may also be restricted system-wide via the SystemCallArchitectures= option in the global
	// configuration. See systemd-system.conf for details.
	SystemCallArchitectures systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a space-separated list of system call names. If this setting is used, all system calls executed by the unit processes
	// for the listed ones will be logged. If the first character of the list is "~", the effect is inverted: all system calls except
	// the listed system calls will be logged. If running in user mode, or in system mode, but without the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability
	// (e.g. setting User=nobody), NoNewPrivileges=yes is implied. This feature makes use of the Secure Computing Mode 2 interfaces
	// of the kernel ('seccomp filtering') and is useful for auditing or setting up a minimal sandboxing environment. This option
	// may be specified more than once, in which case the filter masks are merged. If the empty string is assigned, the filter is
	// reset, all prior assignments will have no effect. This does not affect commands prefixed with "+".
	SystemCallLog systemdconf.Value

	// Sets environment variables for executed processes. Takes a space-separated list of variable assignments. This option
	// may be specified more than once, in which case all listed variables will be set. If the same variable is set twice, the later
	// setting will override the earlier setting. If the empty string is assigned to this option, the list of environment variables
	// is reset, all prior assignments have no effect. Variable expansion is not performed inside the strings, however, specifier
	// expansion is possible. The "$" character has no special meaning. If you need to assign a value containing spaces or the equals
	// sign to a variable, use double quotes (") for the assignment.
	//
	// The names of the variables can contain ASCII letters, digits, and the underscore character. Variable names cannot be empty
	// or start with a digit. In variable values, most characters are allowed, but non-printable characters are currently rejected.
	//
	// Example:
	//
	// 	Environment="VAR1=word1 word2" VAR2=word3 "VAR3=$word 5 6"
	//
	// gives three variables "VAR1", "VAR2", "VAR3" with the values "word1 word2", "word3", "$word 5 6".
	//
	// See environ for details about environment variables.
	//
	// Note that environment variables are not suitable for passing secrets (such as passwords, key material, â€¦) to service processes.
	// Environment variables set for a unit are exposed to unprivileged clients via D-Bus IPC, and generally not understood as
	// being data that requires protection. Moreover, environment variables are propagated down the process tree, including
	// across security boundaries (such as setuid/setgid executables), and hence might leak to processes that should not have
	// access to the secret data. Use LoadCredential= (see below) to pass data to unit processes securely.
	Environment systemdconf.Value

	// Similar to Environment= but reads the environment variables from a text file. The text file should contain new-line-separated
	// variable assignments. Empty lines, lines without an "=" separator, or lines starting with ; or # will be ignored, which
	// may be used for commenting. A line ending with a backslash will be concatenated with the following one, allowing multiline
	// variable definitions. The parser strips leading and trailing whitespace from the values of assignments, unless you use
	// double quotes (").
	//
	// C escapes are supported, but not most control characters. "\t" and "\n" can be used to insert tabs and newlines within EnvironmentFile=.
	//
	// The argument passed should be an absolute filename or wildcard expression, optionally prefixed with "-", which indicates
	// that if the file does not exist, it will not be read and no error or warning message is logged. This option may be specified
	// more than once in which case all specified files are read. If the empty string is assigned to this option, the list of file
	// to read is reset, all prior assignments have no effect.
	//
	// The files listed with this directive will be read shortly before the process is executed (more specifically, after all
	// processes from a previous unit state terminated. This means you can generate these files in one unit state, and read it with
	// this option in the next. The files are read from the file system of the service manager, before any file system changes like
	// bind mounts take place).
	//
	// Settings from these files override settings made with Environment=. If the same variable is set twice from these files,
	// the files will be read in the order they are specified and the later setting will override the earlier setting.
	EnvironmentFile systemdconf.Value

	// Pass environment variables set for the system service manager to executed processes. Takes a space-separated list of
	// variable names. This option may be specified more than once, in which case all listed variables will be passed. If the empty
	// string is assigned to this option, the list of environment variables to pass is reset, all prior assignments have no effect.
	// Variables specified that are not set for the system manager will not be passed and will be silently ignored. Note that this
	// option is only relevant for the system service manager, as system services by default do not automatically inherit any
	// environment variables set for the service manager itself. However, in case of the user service manager all environment
	// variables are passed to the executed processes anyway, hence this option is without effect for the user service manager.
	//
	// Variables set for invoked processes due to this setting are subject to being overridden by those configured with Environment=
	// or EnvironmentFile=.
	//
	// C escapes are supported, but not most control characters. "\t" and "\n" can be used to insert tabs and newlines within EnvironmentFile=.
	//
	// Example:
	//
	// 	PassEnvironment=VAR1 VAR2 VAR3
	//
	// passes three variables "VAR1", "VAR2", "VAR3" with the values set for those variables in PID1.
	//
	// See environ for details about environment variables.
	PassEnvironment systemdconf.Value

	// Explicitly unset environment variable assignments that would normally be passed from the service manager to invoked
	// processes of this unit. Takes a space-separated list of variable names or variable assignments. This option may be specified
	// more than once, in which case all listed variables/assignments will be unset. If the empty string is assigned to this option,
	// the list of environment variables/assignments to unset is reset. If a variable assignment is specified (that is: a variable
	// name, followed by "=", followed by its value), then any environment variable matching this precise assignment is removed.
	// If a variable name is specified (that is a variable name without any following "=" or value), then any assignment matching
	// the variable name, regardless of its value is removed. Note that the effect of UnsetEnvironment= is applied as final step
	// when the environment list passed to executed processes is compiled. That means it may undo assignments from any configuration
	// source, including assignments made through Environment= or EnvironmentFile=, inherited from the system manager's
	// global set of environment variables, inherited via PassEnvironment=, set by the service manager itself (such as $NOTIFY_SOCKET
	// and such), or set by a PAM module (in case PAMName= is used).
	//
	// See environ for details about environment variables.
	UnsetEnvironment systemdconf.Value

	// Controls where file descriptor 0 (STDIN) of the executed processes is connected to. Takes one of null, tty, tty-force,
	// tty-fail, data, file:path, socket or fd:name.
	//
	// If null is selected, standard input will be connected to /dev/null, i.e. all read attempts by the process will result in
	// immediate EOF.
	//
	// If tty is selected, standard input is connected to a TTY (as configured by TTYPath=, see below) and the executed process
	// becomes the controlling process of the terminal. If the terminal is already being controlled by another process, the executed
	// process waits until the current controlling process releases the terminal.
	//
	// tty-force is similar to tty, but the executed process is forcefully and immediately made the controlling process of the
	// terminal, potentially removing previous controlling processes from the terminal.
	//
	// tty-fail is similar to tty, but if the terminal already has a controlling process start-up of the executed process fails.
	//
	// The data option may be used to configure arbitrary textual or binary data to pass via standard input to the executed process.
	// The data to pass is configured via StandardInputText=/StandardInputData= (see below). Note that the actual file descriptor
	// type passed (memory file, regular file, UNIX pipe, â€¦) might depend on the kernel and available privileges. In any case,
	// the file descriptor is read-only, and when read returns the specified data followed by EOF.
	//
	// The file:path option may be used to connect a specific file system object to standard input. An absolute path following
	// the ":" character is expected, which may refer to a regular file, a FIFO or special file. If an AF_UNIX socket in the file system
	// is specified, a stream socket is connected to it. The latter is useful for connecting standard input of processes to arbitrary
	// system services.
	//
	// The socket option is valid in socket-activated services only, and requires the relevant socket unit file (see systemd.socket
	// for details) to have Accept=yes set, or to specify a single socket only. If this option is set, standard input will be connected
	// to the socket the service was activated from, which is primarily useful for compatibility with daemons designed for use
	// with the traditional inetd socket activation daemon.
	//
	// The fd:name option connects standard input to a specific, named file descriptor provided by a socket unit. The name may
	// be specified as part of this option, following a ":" character (e.g. "fd:foobar"). If no name is specified, the name "stdin"
	// is implied (i.e. "fd" is equivalent to "fd:stdin"). At least one socket unit defining the specified name must be provided
	// via the Sockets= option, and the file descriptor name may differ from the name of its containing socket unit. If multiple
	// matches are found, the first one will be used. See FileDescriptorName= in systemd.socket for more details about named
	// file descriptors and their ordering.
	//
	// This setting defaults to null.
	StandardInput systemdconf.Value

	// Controls where file descriptor 1 (stdout) of the executed processes is connected to. Takes one of inherit, null, tty, journal,
	// kmsg, journal+console, kmsg+console, file:path, append:path, socket or fd:name.
	//
	// inherit duplicates the file descriptor of standard input for standard output.
	//
	// null connects standard output to /dev/null, i.e. everything written to it will be lost.
	//
	// tty connects standard output to a tty (as configured via TTYPath=, see below). If the TTY is used for output only, the executed
	// process will not become the controlling process of the terminal, and will not fail or wait for other processes to release
	// the terminal.
	//
	// journal connects standard output with the journal, which is accessible via journalctl. Note that everything that is written
	// to kmsg (see below) is implicitly stored in the journal as well, the specific option listed below is hence a superset of this
	// one. (Also note that any external, additional syslog daemons receive their log data from the journal, too, hence this is
	// the option to use when logging shall be processed with such a daemon.)
	//
	// kmsg connects standard output with the kernel log buffer which is accessible via dmesg, in addition to the journal. The
	// journal daemon might be configured to send all logs to kmsg anyway, in which case this option is no different from journal.
	//
	// journal+console and kmsg+console work in a similar way as the two options above but copy the output to the system console
	// as well.
	//
	// The file:path option may be used to connect a specific file system object to standard output. The semantics are similar
	// to the same option of StandardInput=, see above. If path refers to a regular file on the filesystem, it is opened (created
	// if it doesn't exist yet) for writing at the beginning of the file, but without truncating it. If standard input and output
	// are directed to the same file path, it is opened only once, for reading as well as writing and duplicated. This is particularly
	// useful when the specified path refers to an AF_UNIX socket in the file system, as in that case only a single stream connection
	// is created for both input and output.
	//
	// append:path is similar to file:path above, but it opens the file in append mode.
	//
	// socket connects standard output to a socket acquired via socket activation. The semantics are similar to the same option
	// of StandardInput=, see above.
	//
	// The fd:name option connects standard output to a specific, named file descriptor provided by a socket unit. A name may be
	// specified as part of this option, following a ":" character (e.g. "fd:foobar"). If no name is specified, the name "stdout"
	// is implied (i.e. "fd" is equivalent to "fd:stdout"). At least one socket unit defining the specified name must be provided
	// via the Sockets= option, and the file descriptor name may differ from the name of its containing socket unit. If multiple
	// matches are found, the first one will be used. See FileDescriptorName= in systemd.socket for more details about named
	// descriptors and their ordering.
	//
	// If the standard output (or error output, see below) of a unit is connected to the journal or the kernel log buffer, the unit
	// will implicitly gain a dependency of type After= on systemd-journald.socket (also see the "Implicit Dependencies" section
	// above). Also note that in this case stdout (or stderr, see below) will be an AF_UNIX stream socket, and not a pipe or FIFO that
	// can be re-opened. This means when executing shell scripts the construct echo "hello" > /dev/stderr for writing text to
	// stderr will not work. To mitigate this use the construct echo "hello" >&2 instead, which is mostly equivalent and avoids
	// this pitfall.
	//
	// This setting defaults to the value set with DefaultStandardOutput= in systemd-system.conf, which defaults to journal.
	// Note that setting this parameter might result in additional dependencies to be added to the unit (see above).
	StandardOutput systemdconf.Value

	// Controls where file descriptor 2 (stderr) of the executed processes is connected to. The available options are identical
	// to those of StandardOutput=, with some exceptions: if set to inherit the file descriptor used for standard output is duplicated
	// for standard error, while fd:name will use a default file descriptor name of "stderr".
	//
	// This setting defaults to the value set with DefaultStandardError= in systemd-system.conf, which defaults to inherit.
	// Note that setting this parameter might result in additional dependencies to be added to the unit (see above).
	StandardError systemdconf.Value

	// Configures arbitrary textual or binary data to pass via file descriptor 0 (STDIN) to the executed processes. These settings
	// have no effect unless StandardInput= is set to data. Use this option to embed process input data directly in the unit file.
	//
	// StandardInputText= accepts arbitrary textual data. C-style escapes for special characters as well as the usual "%"-specifiers
	// are resolved. Each time this setting is used the specified text is appended to the per-unit data buffer, followed by a newline
	// character (thus every use appends a new line to the end of the buffer). Note that leading and trailing whitespace of lines
	// configured with this option is removed. If an empty line is specified the buffer is cleared (hence, in order to insert an
	// empty line, add an additional "\n" to the end or beginning of a line).
	//
	// StandardInputData= accepts arbitrary binary data, encoded in Base64. No escape sequences or specifiers are resolved.
	// Any whitespace in the encoded version is ignored during decoding.
	//
	// Note that StandardInputText= and StandardInputData= operate on the same data buffer, and may be mixed in order to configure
	// both binary and textual data for the same input stream. The textual or binary data is joined strictly in the order the settings
	// appear in the unit file. Assigning an empty string to either will reset the data buffer.
	//

	StandardInputData systemdconf.Value

	// Configures filtering by log level of log messages generated by this unit. Takes a syslog log level, one of emerg (lowest

	// priority messages). See syslog for details. By default no filtering is applied (i.e. the default maximum log level is debug).
	// Use this option to configure the logging system to drop log messages of a specific service above the specified level. For
	// example, set LogLevelMax=info in order to turn off debug logging of a particularly chatty unit. Note that the configured
	// level is applied to any log messages written by any of the processes belonging to this unit, sent via any supported logging
	// protocol. The filtering is applied early in the logging pipeline, before any kind of further processing is done. Moreover,
	// messages which pass through this filter successfully might still be dropped by filters applied at a later stage in the logging
	// subsystem. For example, MaxLevelStore= configured in journald.conf might prohibit messages of higher log levels to
	// be stored on disk, even though the per-unit LogLevelMax= permitted it to be processed.
	LogLevelMax systemdconf.Value

	// Configures additional log metadata fields to include in all log records generated by processes associated with this unit.

	// useful for attaching additional metadata to log records of a unit, but given that all fields and values are indexed may also
	// be used to implement cross-unit log record matching. Assign an empty string to reset the list.
	LogExtraFields systemdconf.Value

	// Configures the rate limiting that is applied to messages generated by this unit. If, in the time interval defined by LogRateLimitIntervalSec=,

	// independent from the default log namespace's data store. See systemd-journald.service for details about journal namespaces.
	//
	// Internally, journal namespaces are implemented through Linux mount namespacing and over-mounting the directory that

	//
	// This option is only available for system services and is not supported for services running in per-user instances of the

	LogNamespace systemdconf.Value

	// Sets the process name ("syslog tag") to prefix log lines sent to the logging system or the kernel log buffer with. If not set,

	TTYVTDisallocate systemdconf.Value

	// Pass a credential to the unit. Credentials are limited-size binary or textual objects that may be passed to unit processes.
	// They are primarily used for passing cryptographic keys (both public and private) or certificates, user account information
	// or identity information from host to services. The data is accessible from the unit's processes via the file system, at
	// a read-only location that (if possible and permitted) is backed by non-swappable memory. The data is only accessible to
	// the user associated with the unit, via the User=/DynamicUser= settings (as well as the superuser). When available, the
	// location of credentials is exported as the $CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY environment variable to the unit's processes.
	//
	// The LoadCredential= setting takes a textual ID to use as name for a credential plus a file system path. The ID must be a short
	// ASCII string suitable as filename in the filesystem, and may be chosen freely by the user. If the specified path is absolute
	// it is opened as regular file and the credential data is read from it. If the absolute path refers to an AF_UNIX stream socket
	// in the file system a connection is made to it (only once at unit start-up) and the credential data read from the connection,
	// providing an easy IPC integration point for dynamically providing credentials from other services. If the specified
	// path is not absolute and itself qualifies as valid credential identifier it is understood to refer to a credential that
	// the service manager itself received via the $CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY environment variable, which may be used to propagate
	// credentials from an invoking environment (e.g. a container manager that invoked the service manager) into a service.
	// The contents of the file/socket may be arbitrary binary or textual data, including newline characters and NUL bytes. This
	// option may be used multiple times, each time defining an additional credential to pass to the unit.
	//
	// The credential files/IPC sockets must be accessible to the service manager, but don't have to be directly accessible to
	// the unit's processes: the credential data is read and copied into separate, read-only copies for the unit that are accessible
	// to appropriately privileged processes. This is particularly useful in combination with DynamicUser= as this way privileged
	// data can be made available to processes running under a dynamic UID (i.e. not a previously known one) without having to open
	// up access to all users.
	//
	// In order to reference the path a credential may be read from within a ExecStart= command line use "${CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY}/mycred",
	// e.g. "ExecStart=cat ${CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY}/mycred".
	//
	// Currently, an accumulated credential size limit of 1M bytes per unit is enforced.
	//
	// If referencing an AF_UNIX stream socket to connect to, the connection will originate from an abstract namespace socket,
	// that includes information about the unit and the credential ID in its socket name. Use getpeername to query this information.
	// The returned socket name is formatted as NUL RANDOM "/unit/" UNIT "/" ID, i.e. a NUL byte (as required for abstract namespace
	// socket names), followed by a random string (consisting of alphadecimal characters), followed by the literal string "/unit/",
	// followed by the requesting unit name, followed by the literal character "/", followed by the textual credential ID requested.
	// Example: "\0adf9d86b6eda275e/unit/foobar.service/credx" in case the credential "credx" is requested for a unit "foobar.service".
	// This functionality is useful for using a single listening socket to serve credentials to multiple consumers.
	LoadCredential systemdconf.Value

	// The SetCredential= setting is similar to LoadCredential= but accepts a literal value to use as data for the credential,
	// instead of a file system path to read the data from. Do not use this option for data that is supposed to be secret, as it is accessible
	// to unprivileged processes via IPC. It's only safe to use this for user IDs, public key material and similar non-sensitive
	// data. For everything else use LoadCredential=. In order to embed binary data into the credential data use C-style escaping
	// (i.e. "\n" to embed a newline, or "\x00" to embed a NUL byte).
	//
	// If a credential of the same ID is listed in both LoadCredential= and SetCredential=, the latter will act as default if the
	// former cannot be retrieved. In this case not being able to retrieve the credential from the path specified in LoadCredential=
	// is not considered fatal.
	SetCredential systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a four character identifier string for an utmp and wtmp entry for this service. This should only be set for services
	// such as getty implementations (such as agetty) where utmp/wtmp entries must be created and cleared before and after execution,
	// or for services that shall be executed as if they were run by a getty process (see below). If the configured string is longer
	// than four characters, it is truncated and the terminal four characters are used. This setting interprets %I style string
	// replacements. This setting is unset by default, i.e. no utmp/wtmp entries are created or cleaned up for this service.
	UtmpIdentifier systemdconf.Value

	// Takes one of "init", "login" or "user". If UtmpIdentifier= is set, controls which type of utmp/wtmp entries for this service
	// are generated. This setting has no effect unless UtmpIdentifier= is set too. If "init" is set, only an INIT_PROCESS entry
	// is generated and the invoked process must implement a getty-compatible utmp/wtmp logic. If "login" is set, first an INIT_PROCESS
	// entry, followed by a LOGIN_PROCESS entry is generated. In this case, the invoked process must implement a login-compatible
	// utmp/wtmp logic. If "user" is set, first an INIT_PROCESS entry, then a LOGIN_PROCESS entry and finally a USER_PROCESS
	// entry is generated. In this case, the invoked process may be any process that is suitable to be run as session leader. Defaults

	// Turn on network traffic filtering for IP packets sent and received over AF_INET and AF_INET6 sockets. Both directives
	// take a space separated list of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, each optionally suffixed with an address prefix length in bits after
	// a "/" character. If the suffix is omitted, the address is considered a host address, i.e. the filter covers the whole address
	// (32 bits for IPv4, 128 bits for IPv6).
	//
	// The access lists configured with this option are applied to all sockets created by processes of this unit (or in the case
	// of socket units, associated with it). The lists are implicitly combined with any lists configured for any of the parent
	// slice units this unit might be a member of. By default both access lists are empty. Both ingress and egress traffic is filtered
	// by these settings. In case of ingress traffic the source IP address is checked against these access lists, in case of egress
	// traffic the destination IP address is checked. The following rules are applied in turn:
	//
	// Access is granted when the checked IP address matches an entry in the IPAddressAllow= list.
	//
	// Otherwise, access is denied when the checked IP address matches an entry in the IPAddressDeny= list.
	//
	// Otherwise, access is granted.
	//
	// In order to implement an allow-listing IP firewall, it is recommended to use a IPAddressDeny=any setting on an upper-level
	// slice unit (such as the root slice -.slice or the slice containing all system services system.slice â€“ see systemd.special
	// for details on these slice units), plus individual per-service IPAddressAllow= lines permitting network access to relevant
	// services, and only them.
	//
	// Note that for socket-activated services, the IP access list configured on the socket unit applies to all sockets associated
	// with it directly, but not to any sockets created by the ultimately activated services for it. Conversely, the IP access
	// list configured for the service is not applied to any sockets passed into the service via socket activation. Thus, it is
	// usually a good idea to replicate the IP access lists on both the socket and the service unit. Nevertheless, it may make sense
	// to maintain one list more open and the other one more restricted, depending on the usecase.

	// Control access to specific device nodes by the executed processes. Takes two space-separated strings: a device node specifier
	// followed by a combination of r, w, m to control reading, writing, or creation of the specific device node(s) by the unit (mknod),
	// respectively. On cgroup-v1 this controls the "devices.allow" control group attribute. For details about this control
	// group attribute, see Device Whitelist Controller. In the unified cgroup hierarchy this functionality is implemented
	// using eBPF filtering.
	//
	// The device node specifier is either a path to a device node in the file system, starting with /dev/, or a string starting with
	// either "char-" or "block-" followed by a device group name, as listed in /proc/devices. The latter is useful to allow-list
	// all current and future devices belonging to a specific device group at once. The device group is matched according to filename
	// globbing rules, you may hence use the "*" and "?" wildcards. (Note that such globbing wildcards are not available for device
	// node path specifications!) In order to match device nodes by numeric major/minor, use device node paths in the /dev/char/
	// and /dev/block/ directories. However, matching devices by major/minor is generally not recommended as assignments
	// are neither stable nor portable between systems or different kernel versions.
	//
	// Examples: /dev/sda5 is a path to a device node, referring to an ATA or SCSI block device. "char-pts" and "char-alsa" are
	// specifiers for all pseudo TTYs and all ALSA sound devices, respectively. "char-cpu/*" is a specifier matching all CPU

	// The name of the slice unit to place the unit in. Defaults to system.slice for all non-instantiated units of all unit types

	Slice systemdconf.Value

	// Turns on delegation of further resource control partitioning to processes of the unit. Units where this is enabled may
	// create and manage their own private subhierarchy of control groups below the control group of the unit itself. For unprivileged
	// services (i.e. those using the User= setting) the unit's control group will be made accessible to the relevant user. When
	// enabled the service manager will refrain from manipulating control groups or moving processes below the unit's control
	// group, so that a clear concept of ownership is established: the control group tree above the unit's control group (i.e.
	// towards the root control group) is owned and managed by the service manager of the host, while the control group tree below
	// the unit's control group is owned and managed by the unit itself. Takes either a boolean argument or a list of control group
	// controller names. If true, delegation is turned on, and all supported controllers are enabled for the unit, making them
	// available to the unit's processes for management. If false, delegation is turned off entirely (and no additional controllers
	// are enabled). If set to a list of controllers, delegation is turned on, and the specified controllers are enabled for the
	// unit. Note that additional controllers than the ones specified might be made available as well, depending on configuration
	// of the containing slice unit or other units contained in it. Note that assigning the empty string will enable delegation,
	// but reset the list of controllers, all assignments prior to this will have no effect. Defaults to false.
