	//
	// Added in version 250.
	ExecSearchPath systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a directory path relative to the service's root directory specified by RootDirectory=, or the special value "~".
	// Sets the working directory for executed processes. If set to "~", the home directory of the user specified in User= is used.
	// If not set, defaults to the root directory when systemd is running as a system instance and the respective user's home directory
	// if run as user. If the setting is prefixed with the "-" character, a missing working directory is not considered fatal. If
	// RootDirectory=/RootImage= is not set, then WorkingDirectory= is relative to the root of the system running the service
	// manager. Note that setting this parameter might result in additional dependencies to be added to the unit (see above).
	WorkingDirectory systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a directory path relative to the host's root directory (i.e. the root of the system running the service manager).
	// Sets the root directory for executed processes, with the pivot_root or chroot system call. If this is used, it must be ensured

	RootDirectory systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a path to a block device node or regular file as argument. This call is similar to RootDirectory= however mounts a file
	// system hierarchy from a block device node or loopback file instead of a directory. The device node or file system image file
	// needs to contain a file system without a partition table, or a file system within an MBR/MS-DOS or GPT partition table with
	// only a single Linux-compatible partition, or a set of file systems within a GPT partition table that follows the  Discoverable
	// Partitions Specification.
	//
	// When DevicePolicy= is set to "closed" or "strict", or set to "auto" and DeviceAllow= is set, then this setting adds /dev/loop-control

	RootImage systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a comma-separated list of mount options that will be used on disk images specified by RootImage=. Optionally a partition
	// name can be prefixed, followed by colon, in case the image has multiple partitions, otherwise partition name "root" is
	// implied. Options for multiple partitions can be specified in a single line with space separators. Assigning an empty string

	// This option is only available for system services and is not supported for services running in per-user instances of the
	// service manager.
	//
	// Added in version 247.
	RootImageOptions systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. If enabled, executed processes will run in an ephemeral copy of the root directory or root image.
	// The ephemeral copy is placed in /var/lib/systemd/ephemeral-trees/ while the service is active and is cleaned up when
	// the service is stopped or restarted. If RootDirectory= is used and the root directory is a subvolume, the ephemeral copy
	// will be created by making a snapshot of the subvolume.
	//
	// To make sure making ephemeral copies can be made efficiently, the root directory or root image should be located on the same
	// filesystem as /var/lib/systemd/ephemeral-trees/. When using RootEphemeral= with root directories, btrfs should
	// be used as the filesystem and the root directory should ideally be a subvolume which systemd can snapshot to make the ephemeral
	// copy. For root images, a filesystem with support for reflinks should be used to ensure an efficient ephemeral copy.
	//
	// This option is only available for system services and is not supported for services running in per-user instances of the
	// service manager.
	//
	// Added in version 254.
	RootEphemeral systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a data integrity (dm-verity) root hash specified in hexadecimal, or the path to a file containing a root hash in ASCII
	// hexadecimal format. This option enables data integrity checks using dm-verity, if the used image contains the appropriate
	// integrity data (see above) or if RootVerity= is used. The specified hash must match the root hash of integrity data, and
	// is usually at least 256 bits (and hence 64 formatted hexadecimal characters) long (in case of SHA256 for example). If this
	// option is not specified, but the image file carries the "user.verity.roothash" extended file attribute (see xattr),
	// then the root hash is read from it, also as formatted hexadecimal characters. If the extended file attribute is not found
	// (or is not supported by the underlying file system), but a file with the .roothash suffix is found next to the image file,
	// bearing otherwise the same name (except if the image has the .raw suffix, in which case the root hash file must not have it

	// This option is only available for system services and is not supported for services running in per-user instances of the
	// service manager.
	//
	// Added in version 246.
	RootHash systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a PKCS7 signature of the RootHash= option as a path to a DER-encoded signature file, or as an ASCII base64 string encoding
	// of a DER-encoded signature prefixed by "base64:". The dm-verity volume will only be opened if the signature of the root
	// hash is valid and signed by a public key present in the kernel keyring. If this option is not specified, but a file with the
	// .roothash.p7s suffix is found next to the image file, bearing otherwise the same name (except if the image has the .raw suffix,
	// in which case the signature file must not have it in its name), the signature is read from it and automatically used.

	RootHashSignature systemdconf.Value

	// Takes the path to a data integrity (dm-verity) file. This option enables data integrity checks using dm-verity, if RootImage=

	// be matched by the root hash. If this option is not specified, but a file with the .verity suffix is found next to the image file,
	// bearing otherwise the same name (except if the image has the .raw suffix, in which case the verity data file must not have
	// it in its name), the verity data is read from it and automatically used.
	//
	// This option is supported only for disk images that contain a single file system, without an enveloping partition table.
	// Images that contain a GPT partition table should instead include both root file system and matching Verity data in the same
	// image, implementing the  Discoverable Partitions Specification.
	//
	// This option is only available for system services and is not supported for services running in per-user instances of the
	// service manager.
	//
	// Added in version 246.
	RootVerity systemdconf.Value

	// Takes an image policy string as per systemd.image-policy to use when mounting the disk images (DDI) specified in RootImage=,

	ExtensionImagePolicy systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. If on, a private mount namespace for the unit's processes is created and the API file systems /proc/,
	// /sys/, /dev/ and /run/ (as an empty "tmpfs") are mounted inside of it, unless they are already mounted. Note that this option
	// has no effect unless used in conjunction with RootDirectory=/RootImage= as these four mounts are generally mounted in
	// the host anyway, and unless the root directory is changed, the private mount namespace will be a 1:1 copy of the host's, and
	// include these four mounts. Note that the /dev/ file system of the host is bind mounted if this option is used without PrivateDevices=.
	// To run the service with a private, minimal version of /dev/, combine this option with PrivateDevices=.
	//
	// In order to allow propagating mounts at runtime in a safe manner, /run/systemd/propagate/ on the host will be used to set
	// up new mounts, and /run/host/incoming/ in the private namespace will be used as an intermediate step to store them before
	// being moved to the final mount point.
	//
	// Added in version 233.
	MountAPIVFS systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. If true, sockets from systemd-journald.socket will be bind mounted into the mount namespace.

	//
	// Added in version 257.
	BindLogSockets systemdconf.Value

	// Takes one of "noaccess", "invisible", "ptraceable" or "default" (which it defaults to). When set, this controls the "hidepid="
	// mount option of the "procfs" instance for the unit that controls which directories with process metainformation (/proc/PID)
	// are visible and accessible: when set to "noaccess" the ability to access most of other users' process metadata in /proc/
	// is taken away for processes of the service. When set to "invisible" processes owned by other users are hidden from /proc/.
	// If "ptraceable" all processes that cannot be ptrace()'ed by a process are hidden to it. If "default" no restrictions on
	// /proc/ access or visibility are made. For further details see The /proc Filesystem. It is generally recommended to run
	// most system services with this option set to "invisible". This option is implemented via file system namespacing, and
	// thus cannot be used with services that shall be able to install mount points in the host file system hierarchy. Note that
	// the root user is unaffected by this option, so to be effective it has to be used together with User= or DynamicUser=yes, and
	// also without the "CAP_SYS_PTRACE" capability, which also allows a process to bypass this feature. It cannot be used for
	// services that need to access metainformation about other users' processes. This option implies MountAPIVFS=.
	//
	// If the kernel does not support per-mount point hidepid= mount options this setting remains without effect, and the unit's
	// processes will be able to access and see other process as if the option was not used.

	// This option is only available for system services and is not supported for services running in per-user instances of the
	// service manager.
	//
	// Added in version 247.
	ProtectProc systemdconf.Value

	// Takes one of "all" (the default) and "pid". If "pid", all files and directories not directly associated with process management
	// and introspection are made invisible in the /proc/ file system configured for the unit's processes. This controls the
	// "subset=" mount option of the "procfs" instance for the unit. For further details see The /proc Filesystem. Note that Linux
	// exposes various kernel APIs via /proc/, which are made unavailable with this setting. Since these APIs are used frequently
	// this option is useful only in a few, specific cases, and is not suitable for most non-trivial programs.
	//
	// Much like ProtectProc= above, this is implemented via file system mount namespacing, and hence the same restrictions
	// apply: it is only available to system services, it disables mount propagation to the host mount table, and it implies MountAPIVFS=.
	// Also, like ProtectProc= this setting is gracefully disabled if the used kernel does not support the "subset=" mount option
	// of "procfs".

	// Use the string infinity to configure no limit on a specific resource. The multiplicative suffixes K, M, G, T, P and E (to the
	// base 1024) may be used for resource limits measured in bytes (e.g. "LimitAS=16G"). For the limits referring to time values,
	// the usual time units ms, s, min, h and so on may be used (see systemd.time for details). Note that if no time unit is specified
	// for LimitCPU= the default unit of seconds is implied, while for LimitRTTIME= the default unit of microseconds is implied.
	// Also, note that the effective granularity of the limits might influence their enforcement. For example, time limits specified
	// for LimitCPU= will be rounded up implicitly to multiples of 1s. For LimitNICE= the value may be specified in two syntaxes:
	// if prefixed with "+" or "-", the value is understood as regular Linux nice value in the range -20â€¦19. If not prefixed like
	// this the value is understood as raw resource limit parameter in the range 0â€¦40 (with 0 being equivalent to 1).
	//
	// Note that most process resource limits configured with these options are per-process, and processes may fork in order
	// to acquire a new set of resources that are accounted independently of the original process, and may thus escape limits set.
	// Also note that LimitRSS= is not implemented on Linux, and setting it has no effect. Often it is advisable to prefer the resource
	// controls listed in systemd.resource-control over these per-process limits, as they apply to services as a whole, may
	// be altered dynamically at runtime, and are generally more expressive. For example, MemoryMax= is a more powerful (and
	// working) replacement for LimitRSS=.
	//
	// Note that LimitNPROC= will limit the number of processes from one (real) UID and not the number of processes started (forked)
	// by the service. Therefore the limit is cumulative for all processes running under the same UID. Please also note that the
	// LimitNPROC= will not be enforced if the service is running as root (and not dropping privileges). Due to these limitations,
	// TasksMax= (see systemd.resource-control) is typically a better choice than LimitNPROC=.

	LimitCPU systemdconf.Value

	// Set soft and hard limits on various resources for executed processes. See setrlimit for details on the process resource
	// limit concept. Process resource limits may be specified in two formats: either as single value to set a specific soft and
	// hard limit to the same value, or as colon-separated pair soft:hard to set both limits individually (e.g. "LimitAS=4G:16G").
	// Use the string infinity to configure no limit on a specific resource. The multiplicative suffixes K, M, G, T, P and E (to the
	// base 1024) may be used for resource limits measured in bytes (e.g. "LimitAS=16G"). For the limits referring to time values,
	// the usual time units ms, s, min, h and so on may be used (see systemd.time for details). Note that if no time unit is specified
	// for LimitCPU= the default unit of seconds is implied, while for LimitRTTIME= the default unit of microseconds is implied.
	// Also, note that the effective granularity of the limits might influence their enforcement. For example, time limits specified
	// for LimitCPU= will be rounded up implicitly to multiples of 1s. For LimitNICE= the value may be specified in two syntaxes:
	// if prefixed with "+" or "-", the value is understood as regular Linux nice value in the range -20â€¦19. If not prefixed like
	// this the value is understood as raw resource limit parameter in the range 0â€¦40 (with 0 being equivalent to 1).
	//
	// Note that most process resource limits configured with these options are per-process, and processes may fork in order
	// to acquire a new set of resources that are accounted independently of the original process, and may thus escape limits set.
	// Also note that LimitRSS= is not implemented on Linux, and setting it has no effect. Often it is advisable to prefer the resource
	// controls listed in systemd.resource-control over these per-process limits, as they apply to services as a whole, may
	// be altered dynamically at runtime, and are generally more expressive. For example, MemoryMax= is a more powerful (and
	// working) replacement for LimitRSS=.
	//
	// Note that LimitNPROC= will limit the number of processes from one (real) UID and not the number of processes started (forked)
	// by the service. Therefore the limit is cumulative for all processes running under the same UID. Please also note that the
	// LimitNPROC= will not be enforced if the service is running as root (and not dropping privileges). Due to these limitations,
	// TasksMax= (see systemd.resource-control) is typically a better choice than LimitNPROC=.
	//
	// Resource limits not configured explicitly for a unit default to the value configured in the various DefaultLimitCPU=,
	// DefaultLimitFSIZE=, â€¦ options available in systemd-system.conf, and â€“ if not configured there â€“ the kernel or per-user
	// defaults, as defined by the OS (the latter only for user services, see below).

	LimitFSIZE systemdconf.Value

	// Set soft and hard limits on various resources for executed processes. See setrlimit for details on the process resource
	// limit concept. Process resource limits may be specified in two formats: either as single value to set a specific soft and
	// hard limit to the same value, or as colon-separated pair soft:hard to set both limits individually (e.g. "LimitAS=4G:16G").
	// Use the string infinity to configure no limit on a specific resource. The multiplicative suffixes K, M, G, T, P and E (to the
	// base 1024) may be used for resource limits measured in bytes (e.g. "LimitAS=16G"). For the limits referring to time values,
	// the usual time units ms, s, min, h and so on may be used (see systemd.time for details). Note that if no time unit is specified
	// for LimitCPU= the default unit of seconds is implied, while for LimitRTTIME= the default unit of microseconds is implied.
	// Also, note that the effective granularity of the limits might influence their enforcement. For example, time limits specified
	// for LimitCPU= will be rounded up implicitly to multiples of 1s. For LimitNICE= the value may be specified in two syntaxes:
	// if prefixed with "+" or "-", the value is understood as regular Linux nice value in the range -20â€¦19. If not prefixed like
	// this the value is understood as raw resource limit parameter in the range 0â€¦40 (with 0 being equivalent to 1).
	//
	// Note that most process resource limits configured with these options are per-process, and processes may fork in order
	// to acquire a new set of resources that are accounted independently of the original process, and may thus escape limits set.
	// Also note that LimitRSS= is not implemented on Linux, and setting it has no effect. Often it is advisable to prefer the resource
	// controls listed in systemd.resource-control over these per-process limits, as they apply to services as a whole, may
	// be altered dynamically at runtime, and are generally more expressive. For example, MemoryMax= is a more powerful (and
	// working) replacement for LimitRSS=.
	//
	// Note that LimitNPROC= will limit the number of processes from one (real) UID and not the number of processes started (forked)
	// by the service. Therefore the limit is cumulative for all processes running under the same UID. Please also note that the
	// LimitNPROC= will not be enforced if the service is running as root (and not dropping privileges). Due to these limitations,
	// TasksMax= (see systemd.resource-control) is typically a better choice than LimitNPROC=.
	//
	// Resource limits not configured explicitly for a unit default to the value configured in the various DefaultLimitCPU=,
	// DefaultLimitFSIZE=, â€¦ options available in systemd-system.conf, and â€“ if not configured there â€“ the kernel or per-user
	// defaults, as defined by the OS (the latter only for user services, see below).
	//
	// For system units these resource limits may be chosen freely. When these settings are configured in a user service (i.e.
	// a service run by the per-user instance of the service manager) they cannot be used to raise the limits above those set for
	// the user manager itself when it was first invoked, as the user's service manager generally lacks the privileges to do so.
	// In user context these configuration options are hence only useful to lower the limits passed in or to raise the soft limit
	// to the maximum of the hard limit as configured for the user. To raise the user's limits further, the available configuration
	// mechanisms differ between operating systems, but typically require privileges. In most cases it is possible to configure
	// higher per-user resource limits via PAM or by setting limits on the system service encapsulating the user's service manager,
	// i.e. the user's instance of user@.service. After making such changes, make sure to restart the user's service manager.

	LimitDATA systemdconf.Value

	// Set soft and hard limits on various resources for executed processes. See setrlimit for details on the process resource
	// limit concept. Process resource limits may be specified in two formats: either as single value to set a specific soft and
	// hard limit to the same value, or as colon-separated pair soft:hard to set both limits individually (e.g. "LimitAS=4G:16G").
	// Use the string infinity to configure no limit on a specific resource. The multiplicative suffixes K, M, G, T, P and E (to the
	// base 1024) may be used for resource limits measured in bytes (e.g. "LimitAS=16G"). For the limits referring to time values,
	// the usual time units ms, s, min, h and so on may be used (see systemd.time for details). Note that if no time unit is specified
	// for LimitCPU= the default unit of seconds is implied, while for LimitRTTIME= the default unit of microseconds is implied.
	// Also, note that the effective granularity of the limits might influence their enforcement. For example, time limits specified
	// for LimitCPU= will be rounded up implicitly to multiples of 1s. For LimitNICE= the value may be specified in two syntaxes:
	// if prefixed with "+" or "-", the value is understood as regular Linux nice value in the range -20â€¦19. If not prefixed like
	// this the value is understood as raw resource limit parameter in the range 0â€¦40 (with 0 being equivalent to 1).
	//
	// Note that most process resource limits configured with these options are per-process, and processes may fork in order
	// to acquire a new set of resources that are accounted independently of the original process, and may thus escape limits set.
	// Also note that LimitRSS= is not implemented on Linux, and setting it has no effect. Often it is advisable to prefer the resource
	// controls listed in systemd.resource-control over these per-process limits, as they apply to services as a whole, may
	// be altered dynamically at runtime, and are generally more expressive. For example, MemoryMax= is a more powerful (and
	// working) replacement for LimitRSS=.
	//
	// Note that LimitNPROC= will limit the number of processes from one (real) UID and not the number of processes started (forked)
	// by the service. Therefore the limit is cumulative for all processes running under the same UID. Please also note that the
	// LimitNPROC= will not be enforced if the service is running as root (and not dropping privileges). Due to these limitations,
	// TasksMax= (see systemd.resource-control) is typically a better choice than LimitNPROC=.
	//
	// Resource limits not configured explicitly for a unit default to the value configured in the various DefaultLimitCPU=,
	// DefaultLimitFSIZE=, â€¦ options available in systemd-system.conf, and â€“ if not configured there â€“ the kernel or per-user
	// defaults, as defined by the OS (the latter only for user services, see below).
	//
	// For system units these resource limits may be chosen freely. When these settings are configured in a user service (i.e.
	// a service run by the per-user instance of the service manager) they cannot be used to raise the limits above those set for
	// the user manager itself when it was first invoked, as the user's service manager generally lacks the privileges to do so.
	// In user context these configuration options are hence only useful to lower the limits passed in or to raise the soft limit
	// to the maximum of the hard limit as configured for the user. To raise the user's limits further, the available configuration
	// mechanisms differ between operating systems, but typically require privileges. In most cases it is possible to configure
	// higher per-user resource limits via PAM or by setting limits on the system service encapsulating the user's service manager,
	// i.e. the user's instance of user@.service. After making such changes, make sure to restart the user's service manager.

	LimitCORE systemdconf.Value

	// Set soft and hard limits on various resources for executed processes. See setrlimit for details on the process resource
	// limit concept. Process resource limits may be specified in two formats: either as single value to set a specific soft and
	// hard limit to the same value, or as colon-separated pair soft:hard to set both limits individually (e.g. "LimitAS=4G:16G").
	// Use the string infinity to configure no limit on a specific resource. The multiplicative suffixes K, M, G, T, P and E (to the
	// base 1024) may be used for resource limits measured in bytes (e.g. "LimitAS=16G"). For the limits referring to time values,
	// the usual time units ms, s, min, h and so on may be used (see systemd.time for details). Note that if no time unit is specified
	// for LimitCPU= the default unit of seconds is implied, while for LimitRTTIME= the default unit of microseconds is implied.
	// Also, note that the effective granularity of the limits might influence their enforcement. For example, time limits specified
	// for LimitCPU= will be rounded up implicitly to multiples of 1s. For LimitNICE= the value may be specified in two syntaxes:
	// if prefixed with "+" or "-", the value is understood as regular Linux nice value in the range -20â€¦19. If not prefixed like
	// this the value is understood as raw resource limit parameter in the range 0â€¦40 (with 0 being equivalent to 1).
	//
	// Note that most process resource limits configured with these options are per-process, and processes may fork in order
	// to acquire a new set of resources that are accounted independently of the original process, and may thus escape limits set.
	// Also note that LimitRSS= is not implemented on Linux, and setting it has no effect. Often it is advisable to prefer the resource
	// controls listed in systemd.resource-control over these per-process limits, as they apply to services as a whole, may
	// be altered dynamically at runtime, and are generally more expressive. For example, MemoryMax= is a more powerful (and
	// working) replacement for LimitRSS=.
	//
	// Note that LimitNPROC= will limit the number of processes from one (real) UID and not the number of processes started (forked)
	// by the service. Therefore the limit is cumulative for all processes running under the same UID. Please also note that the
	// LimitNPROC= will not be enforced if the service is running as root (and not dropping privileges). Due to these limitations,
	// TasksMax= (see systemd.resource-control) is typically a better choice than LimitNPROC=.
	//
	// Resource limits not configured explicitly for a unit default to the value configured in the various DefaultLimitCPU=,
	// DefaultLimitFSIZE=, â€¦ options available in systemd-system.conf, and â€“ if not configured there â€“ the kernel or per-user
	// defaults, as defined by the OS (the latter only for user services, see below).
	//
	// For system units these resource limits may be chosen freely. When these settings are configured in a user service (i.e.
	// a service run by the per-user instance of the service manager) they cannot be used to raise the limits above those set for
	// the user manager itself when it was first invoked, as the user's service manager generally lacks the privileges to do so.
	// In user context these configuration options are hence only useful to lower the limits passed in or to raise the soft limit
	// to the maximum of the hard limit as configured for the user. To raise the user's limits further, the available configuration
	// mechanisms differ between operating systems, but typically require privileges. In most cases it is possible to configure
	// higher per-user resource limits via PAM or by setting limits on the system service encapsulating the user's service manager,
	// i.e. the user's instance of user@.service. After making such changes, make sure to restart the user's service manager.

	LimitRSS systemdconf.Value

	// Set soft and hard limits on various resources for executed processes. See setrlimit for details on the process resource
	// limit concept. Process resource limits may be specified in two formats: either as single value to set a specific soft and
	// hard limit to the same value, or as colon-separated pair soft:hard to set both limits individually (e.g. "LimitAS=4G:16G").
	// Use the string infinity to configure no limit on a specific resource. The multiplicative suffixes K, M, G, T, P and E (to the
	// base 1024) may be used for resource limits measured in bytes (e.g. "LimitAS=16G"). For the limits referring to time values,
	// the usual time units ms, s, min, h and so on may be used (see systemd.time for details). Note that if no time unit is specified
	// for LimitCPU= the default unit of seconds is implied, while for LimitRTTIME= the default unit of microseconds is implied.
	// Also, note that the effective granularity of the limits might influence their enforcement. For example, time limits specified
	// for LimitCPU= will be rounded up implicitly to multiples of 1s. For LimitNICE= the value may be specified in two syntaxes:
	// if prefixed with "+" or "-", the value is understood as regular Linux nice value in the range -20â€¦19. If not prefixed like
	// this the value is understood as raw resource limit parameter in the range 0â€¦40 (with 0 being equivalent to 1).
	//
	// Note that most process resource limits configured with these options are per-process, and processes may fork in order
	// to acquire a new set of resources that are accounted independently of the original process, and may thus escape limits set.
	// Also note that LimitRSS= is not implemented on Linux, and setting it has no effect. Often it is advisable to prefer the resource
	// controls listed in systemd.resource-control over these per-process limits, as they apply to services as a whole, may
	// be altered dynamically at runtime, and are generally more expressive. For example, MemoryMax= is a more powerful (and
	// working) replacement for LimitRSS=.
	//
	// Note that LimitNPROC= will limit the number of processes from one (real) UID and not the number of processes started (forked)
	// by the service. Therefore the limit is cumulative for all processes running under the same UID. Please also note that the
	// LimitNPROC= will not be enforced if the service is running as root (and not dropping privileges). Due to these limitations,
	// TasksMax= (see systemd.resource-control) is typically a better choice than LimitNPROC=.
	//
	// Resource limits not configured explicitly for a unit default to the value configured in the various DefaultLimitCPU=,
	// DefaultLimitFSIZE=, â€¦ options available in systemd-system.conf, and â€“ if not configured there â€“ the kernel or per-user
	// defaults, as defined by the OS (the latter only for user services, see below).
	//
	// For system units these resource limits may be chosen freely. When these settings are configured in a user service (i.e.
	// a service run by the per-user instance of the service manager) they cannot be used to raise the limits above those set for
	// the user manager itself when it was first invoked, as the user's service manager generally lacks the privileges to do so.
	// In user context these configuration options are hence only useful to lower the limits passed in or to raise the soft limit
	// to the maximum of the hard limit as configured for the user. To raise the user's limits further, the available configuration
	// mechanisms differ between operating systems, but typically require privileges. In most cases it is possible to configure
	// higher per-user resource limits via PAM or by setting limits on the system service encapsulating the user's service manager,
	// i.e. the user's instance of user@.service. After making such changes, make sure to restart the user's service manager.

	LimitAS systemdconf.Value

	// Set soft and hard limits on various resources for executed processes. See setrlimit for details on the process resource
	// limit concept. Process resource limits may be specified in two formats: either as single value to set a specific soft and
	// hard limit to the same value, or as colon-separated pair soft:hard to set both limits individually (e.g. "LimitAS=4G:16G").
	// Use the string infinity to configure no limit on a specific resource. The multiplicative suffixes K, M, G, T, P and E (to the
	// base 1024) may be used for resource limits measured in bytes (e.g. "LimitAS=16G"). For the limits referring to time values,
	// the usual time units ms, s, min, h and so on may be used (see systemd.time for details). Note that if no time unit is specified
	// for LimitCPU= the default unit of seconds is implied, while for LimitRTTIME= the default unit of microseconds is implied.
	// Also, note that the effective granularity of the limits might influence their enforcement. For example, time limits specified
	// for LimitCPU= will be rounded up implicitly to multiples of 1s. For LimitNICE= the value may be specified in two syntaxes:
	// if prefixed with "+" or "-", the value is understood as regular Linux nice value in the range -20â€¦19. If not prefixed like
	// this the value is understood as raw resource limit parameter in the range 0â€¦40 (with 0 being equivalent to 1).
	//
	// Note that most process resource limits configured with these options are per-process, and processes may fork in order
	// to acquire a new set of resources that are accounted independently of the original process, and may thus escape limits set.
	// Also note that LimitRSS= is not implemented on Linux, and setting it has no effect. Often it is advisable to prefer the resource
	// controls listed in systemd.resource-control over these per-process limits, as they apply to services as a whole, may
	// be altered dynamically at runtime, and are generally more expressive. For example, MemoryMax= is a more powerful (and
	// working) replacement for LimitRSS=.
	//
	// Note that LimitNPROC= will limit the number of processes from one (real) UID and not the number of processes started (forked)
	// by the service. Therefore the limit is cumulative for all processes running under the same UID. Please also note that the
	// LimitNPROC= will not be enforced if the service is running as root (and not dropping privileges). Due to these limitations,
	// TasksMax= (see systemd.resource-control) is typically a better choice than LimitNPROC=.
	//
	// Resource limits not configured explicitly for a unit default to the value configured in the various DefaultLimitCPU=,
	// DefaultLimitFSIZE=, â€¦ options available in systemd-system.conf, and â€“ if not configured there â€“ the kernel or per-user
	// defaults, as defined by the OS (the latter only for user services, see below).

	LimitNPROC systemdconf.Value

	// Set soft and hard limits on various resources for executed processes. See setrlimit for details on the process resource
	// limit concept. Process resource limits may be specified in two formats: either as single value to set a specific soft and
	// hard limit to the same value, or as colon-separated pair soft:hard to set both limits individually (e.g. "LimitAS=4G:16G").
	// Use the string infinity to configure no limit on a specific resource. The multiplicative suffixes K, M, G, T, P and E (to the
	// base 1024) may be used for resource limits measured in bytes (e.g. "LimitAS=16G"). For the limits referring to time values,
	// the usual time units ms, s, min, h and so on may be used (see systemd.time for details). Note that if no time unit is specified
	// for LimitCPU= the default unit of seconds is implied, while for LimitRTTIME= the default unit of microseconds is implied.
	// Also, note that the effective granularity of the limits might influence their enforcement. For example, time limits specified
	// for LimitCPU= will be rounded up implicitly to multiples of 1s. For LimitNICE= the value may be specified in two syntaxes:
	// if prefixed with "+" or "-", the value is understood as regular Linux nice value in the range -20â€¦19. If not prefixed like
	// this the value is understood as raw resource limit parameter in the range 0â€¦40 (with 0 being equivalent to 1).
	//
	// Note that most process resource limits configured with these options are per-process, and processes may fork in order
	// to acquire a new set of resources that are accounted independently of the original process, and may thus escape limits set.
	// Also note that LimitRSS= is not implemented on Linux, and setting it has no effect. Often it is advisable to prefer the resource
	// controls listed in systemd.resource-control over these per-process limits, as they apply to services as a whole, may
	// be altered dynamically at runtime, and are generally more expressive. For example, MemoryMax= is a more powerful (and
	// working) replacement for LimitRSS=.
	//
	// Note that LimitNPROC= will limit the number of processes from one (real) UID and not the number of processes started (forked)
	// by the service. Therefore the limit is cumulative for all processes running under the same UID. Please also note that the
	// LimitNPROC= will not be enforced if the service is running as root (and not dropping privileges). Due to these limitations,
	// TasksMax= (see systemd.resource-control) is typically a better choice than LimitNPROC=.
	//
	// Resource limits not configured explicitly for a unit default to the value configured in the various DefaultLimitCPU=,
	// DefaultLimitFSIZE=, â€¦ options available in systemd-system.conf, and â€“ if not configured there â€“ the kernel or per-user
	// defaults, as defined by the OS (the latter only for user services, see below).
	//
	// For system units these resource limits may be chosen freely. When these settings are configured in a user service (i.e.
	// a service run by the per-user instance of the service manager) they cannot be used to raise the limits above those set for
	// the user manager itself when it was first invoked, as the user's service manager generally lacks the privileges to do so.
	// In user context these configuration options are hence only useful to lower the limits passed in or to raise the soft limit
	// to the maximum of the hard limit as configured for the user. To raise the user's limits further, the available configuration
	// mechanisms differ between operating systems, but typically require privileges. In most cases it is possible to configure
	// higher per-user resource limits via PAM or by setting limits on the system service encapsulating the user's service manager,
	// i.e. the user's instance of user@.service. After making such changes, make sure to restart the user's service manager.

	LimitMEMLOCK systemdconf.Value

	// Set soft and hard limits on various resources for executed processes. See setrlimit for details on the process resource
	// limit concept. Process resource limits may be specified in two formats: either as single value to set a specific soft and
	// hard limit to the same value, or as colon-separated pair soft:hard to set both limits individually (e.g. "LimitAS=4G:16G").
	// Use the string infinity to configure no limit on a specific resource. The multiplicative suffixes K, M, G, T, P and E (to the
	// base 1024) may be used for resource limits measured in bytes (e.g. "LimitAS=16G"). For the limits referring to time values,
	// the usual time units ms, s, min, h and so on may be used (see systemd.time for details). Note that if no time unit is specified
	// for LimitCPU= the default unit of seconds is implied, while for LimitRTTIME= the default unit of microseconds is implied.
	// Also, note that the effective granularity of the limits might influence their enforcement. For example, time limits specified
	// for LimitCPU= will be rounded up implicitly to multiples of 1s. For LimitNICE= the value may be specified in two syntaxes:
	// if prefixed with "+" or "-", the value is understood as regular Linux nice value in the range -20â€¦19. If not prefixed like
	// this the value is understood as raw resource limit parameter in the range 0â€¦40 (with 0 being equivalent to 1).
	//
	// Note that most process resource limits configured with these options are per-process, and processes may fork in order
	// to acquire a new set of resources that are accounted independently of the original process, and may thus escape limits set.
	// Also note that LimitRSS= is not implemented on Linux, and setting it has no effect. Often it is advisable to prefer the resource
	// controls listed in systemd.resource-control over these per-process limits, as they apply to services as a whole, may
	// be altered dynamically at runtime, and are generally more expressive. For example, MemoryMax= is a more powerful (and
	// working) replacement for LimitRSS=.
	//
	// Note that LimitNPROC= will limit the number of processes from one (real) UID and not the number of processes started (forked)
	// by the service. Therefore the limit is cumulative for all processes running under the same UID. Please also note that the
	// LimitNPROC= will not be enforced if the service is running as root (and not dropping privileges). Due to these limitations,
	// TasksMax= (see systemd.resource-control) is typically a better choice than LimitNPROC=.
	//
	// Resource limits not configured explicitly for a unit default to the value configured in the various DefaultLimitCPU=,
	// DefaultLimitFSIZE=, â€¦ options available in systemd-system.conf, and â€“ if not configured there â€“ the kernel or per-user
	// defaults, as defined by the OS (the latter only for user services, see below).
	//
	// For system units these resource limits may be chosen freely. When these settings are configured in a user service (i.e.
	// a service run by the per-user instance of the service manager) they cannot be used to raise the limits above those set for
	// the user manager itself when it was first invoked, as the user's service manager generally lacks the privileges to do so.
	// In user context these configuration options are hence only useful to lower the limits passed in or to raise the soft limit
	// to the maximum of the hard limit as configured for the user. To raise the user's limits further, the available configuration
	// mechanisms differ between operating systems, but typically require privileges. In most cases it is possible to configure
	// higher per-user resource limits via PAM or by setting limits on the system service encapsulating the user's service manager,
	// i.e. the user's instance of user@.service. After making such changes, make sure to restart the user's service manager.

	LimitSIGPENDING systemdconf.Value

	// Set soft and hard limits on various resources for executed processes. See setrlimit for details on the process resource
	// limit concept. Process resource limits may be specified in two formats: either as single value to set a specific soft and
	// hard limit to the same value, or as colon-separated pair soft:hard to set both limits individually (e.g. "LimitAS=4G:16G").
	// Use the string infinity to configure no limit on a specific resource. The multiplicative suffixes K, M, G, T, P and E (to the
	// base 1024) may be used for resource limits measured in bytes (e.g. "LimitAS=16G"). For the limits referring to time values,
	// the usual time units ms, s, min, h and so on may be used (see systemd.time for details). Note that if no time unit is specified
	// for LimitCPU= the default unit of seconds is implied, while for LimitRTTIME= the default unit of microseconds is implied.
	// Also, note that the effective granularity of the limits might influence their enforcement. For example, time limits specified
	// for LimitCPU= will be rounded up implicitly to multiples of 1s. For LimitNICE= the value may be specified in two syntaxes:
	// if prefixed with "+" or "-", the value is understood as regular Linux nice value in the range -20â€¦19. If not prefixed like
	// this the value is understood as raw resource limit parameter in the range 0â€¦40 (with 0 being equivalent to 1).
	//
	// Note that most process resource limits configured with these options are per-process, and processes may fork in order
	// to acquire a new set of resources that are accounted independently of the original process, and may thus escape limits set.
	// Also note that LimitRSS= is not implemented on Linux, and setting it has no effect. Often it is advisable to prefer the resource
	// controls listed in systemd.resource-control over these per-process limits, as they apply to services as a whole, may
	// be altered dynamically at runtime, and are generally more expressive. For example, MemoryMax= is a more powerful (and
	// working) replacement for LimitRSS=.
	//
	// Note that LimitNPROC= will limit the number of processes from one (real) UID and not the number of processes started (forked)
	// by the service. Therefore the limit is cumulative for all processes running under the same UID. Please also note that the
	// LimitNPROC= will not be enforced if the service is running as root (and not dropping privileges). Due to these limitations,
	// TasksMax= (see systemd.resource-control) is typically a better choice than LimitNPROC=.
	//
	// Resource limits not configured explicitly for a unit default to the value configured in the various DefaultLimitCPU=,
	// DefaultLimitFSIZE=, â€¦ options available in systemd-system.conf, and â€“ if not configured there â€“ the kernel or per-user
	// defaults, as defined by the OS (the latter only for user services, see below).
	//
	// For system units these resource limits may be chosen freely. When these settings are configured in a user service (i.e.
	// a service run by the per-user instance of the service manager) they cannot be used to raise the limits above those set for
	// the user manager itself when it was first invoked, as the user's service manager generally lacks the privileges to do so.
	// In user context these configuration options are hence only useful to lower the limits passed in or to raise the soft limit
	// to the maximum of the hard limit as configured for the user. To raise the user's limits further, the available configuration
	// mechanisms differ between operating systems, but typically require privileges. In most cases it is possible to configure
	// higher per-user resource limits via PAM or by setting limits on the system service encapsulating the user's service manager,
	// i.e. the user's instance of user@.service. After making such changes, make sure to restart the user's service manager.

	LimitMSGQUEUE systemdconf.Value

	// Set soft and hard limits on various resources for executed processes. See setrlimit for details on the process resource
	// limit concept. Process resource limits may be specified in two formats: either as single value to set a specific soft and
	// hard limit to the same value, or as colon-separated pair soft:hard to set both limits individually (e.g. "LimitAS=4G:16G").
	// Use the string infinity to configure no limit on a specific resource. The multiplicative suffixes K, M, G, T, P and E (to the
	// base 1024) may be used for resource limits measured in bytes (e.g. "LimitAS=16G"). For the limits referring to time values,
	// the usual time units ms, s, min, h and so on may be used (see systemd.time for details). Note that if no time unit is specified
	// for LimitCPU= the default unit of seconds is implied, while for LimitRTTIME= the default unit of microseconds is implied.
	// Also, note that the effective granularity of the limits might influence their enforcement. For example, time limits specified
	// for LimitCPU= will be rounded up implicitly to multiples of 1s. For LimitNICE= the value may be specified in two syntaxes:
	// if prefixed with "+" or "-", the value is understood as regular Linux nice value in the range -20â€¦19. If not prefixed like
	// this the value is understood as raw resource limit parameter in the range 0â€¦40 (with 0 being equivalent to 1).
	//
	// Note that most process resource limits configured with these options are per-process, and processes may fork in order
	// to acquire a new set of resources that are accounted independently of the original process, and may thus escape limits set.
	// Also note that LimitRSS= is not implemented on Linux, and setting it has no effect. Often it is advisable to prefer the resource
	// controls listed in systemd.resource-control over these per-process limits, as they apply to services as a whole, may
	// be altered dynamically at runtime, and are generally more expressive. For example, MemoryMax= is a more powerful (and
	// working) replacement for LimitRSS=.
	//
	// Note that LimitNPROC= will limit the number of processes from one (real) UID and not the number of processes started (forked)
	// by the service. Therefore the limit is cumulative for all processes running under the same UID. Please also note that the
	// LimitNPROC= will not be enforced if the service is running as root (and not dropping privileges). Due to these limitations,
	// TasksMax= (see systemd.resource-control) is typically a better choice than LimitNPROC=.
	//
	// Resource limits not configured explicitly for a unit default to the value configured in the various DefaultLimitCPU=,
	// DefaultLimitFSIZE=, â€¦ options available in systemd-system.conf, and â€“ if not configured there â€“ the kernel or per-user
	// defaults, as defined by the OS (the latter only for user services, see below).
	//
	// For system units these resource limits may be chosen freely. When these settings are configured in a user service (i.e.
	// a service run by the per-user instance of the service manager) they cannot be used to raise the limits above those set for
	// the user manager itself when it was first invoked, as the user's service manager generally lacks the privileges to do so.
	// In user context these configuration options are hence only useful to lower the limits passed in or to raise the soft limit
	// to the maximum of the hard limit as configured for the user. To raise the user's limits further, the available configuration
	// mechanisms differ between operating systems, but typically require privileges. In most cases it is possible to configure
	// higher per-user resource limits via PAM or by setting limits on the system service encapsulating the user's service manager,
	// i.e. the user's instance of user@.service. After making such changes, make sure to restart the user's service manager.

	LimitRTPRIO systemdconf.Value

	// Set soft and hard limits on various resources for executed processes. See setrlimit for details on the process resource
	// limit concept. Process resource limits may be specified in two formats: either as single value to set a specific soft and
	// hard limit to the same value, or as colon-separated pair soft:hard to set both limits individually (e.g. "LimitAS=4G:16G").
	// Use the string infinity to configure no limit on a specific resource. The multiplicative suffixes K, M, G, T, P and E (to the
	// base 1024) may be used for resource limits measured in bytes (e.g. "LimitAS=16G"). For the limits referring to time values,
	// the usual time units ms, s, min, h and so on may be used (see systemd.time for details). Note that if no time unit is specified
	// for LimitCPU= the default unit of seconds is implied, while for LimitRTTIME= the default unit of microseconds is implied.
	// Also, note that the effective granularity of the limits might influence their enforcement. For example, time limits specified
	// for LimitCPU= will be rounded up implicitly to multiples of 1s. For LimitNICE= the value may be specified in two syntaxes:
	// if prefixed with "+" or "-", the value is understood as regular Linux nice value in the range -20â€¦19. If not prefixed like
	// this the value is understood as raw resource limit parameter in the range 0â€¦40 (with 0 being equivalent to 1).
	//
	// Note that most process resource limits configured with these options are per-process, and processes may fork in order
	// to acquire a new set of resources that are accounted independently of the original process, and may thus escape limits set.
	// Also note that LimitRSS= is not implemented on Linux, and setting it has no effect. Often it is advisable to prefer the resource
	// controls listed in systemd.resource-control over these per-process limits, as they apply to services as a whole, may
	// be altered dynamically at runtime, and are generally more expressive. For example, MemoryMax= is a more powerful (and
	// working) replacement for LimitRSS=.
	//
	// Note that LimitNPROC= will limit the number of processes from one (real) UID and not the number of processes started (forked)
	// by the service. Therefore the limit is cumulative for all processes running under the same UID. Please also note that the
	// LimitNPROC= will not be enforced if the service is running as root (and not dropping privileges). Due to these limitations,
	// TasksMax= (see systemd.resource-control) is typically a better choice than LimitNPROC=.
	//
	// Resource limits not configured explicitly for a unit default to the value configured in the various DefaultLimitCPU=,
	// DefaultLimitFSIZE=, â€¦ options available in systemd-system.conf, and â€“ if not configured there â€“ the kernel or per-user
	// defaults, as defined by the OS (the latter only for user services, see below).

	LimitRTTIME systemdconf.Value

	// Controls the file mode creation mask. Takes an access mode in octal notation. See umask for details. Defaults to 0022 for
	// system units. For user units the default value is inherited from the per-user service manager (whose default is in turn
	// inherited from the system service manager, and thus typically also is 0022 â€” unless overridden by a PAM module). In order
	// to change the per-user mask for all user services, consider setting the UMask= setting of the user's user@.service system
	// service instance. The per-user umask may also be set via the umask field of a user's JSON User Record (for users managed by
	// systemd-homed.service this field may be controlled via homectl --umask=). It may also be set via a PAM module, such as pam_umask.
	UMask systemdconf.Value

	// Controls which types of memory mappings will be saved if the process dumps core (using the /proc/pid/coredump_filter
	// file). Takes a whitespace-separated combination of mapping type names or numbers (with the default base 16). Mapping
	// type names are private-anonymous, shared-anonymous, private-file-backed, shared-file-backed, elf-headers, private-huge,
	// shared-huge, private-dax, shared-dax, and the special values all (all types) and default (the kernel default of "private-anonymous
	// shared-anonymous elf-headers private-huge"). See core for the meaning of the mapping types. When specified multiple

	// Added in version 246.
	CoredumpFilter systemdconf.Value

	// Controls how the kernel session keyring is set up for the service (see session-keyring for details on the session keyring).
	// Takes one of inherit, private, shared. If set to inherit no special keyring setup is done, and the kernel's default behaviour
	// is applied. If private is used a new session keyring is allocated when a service process is invoked, and it is not linked up
	// with any user keyring. This is the recommended setting for system services, as this ensures that multiple services running
	// under the same system user ID (in particular the root user) do not share their key material among each other. If shared is
	// used a new session keyring is allocated as for private, but the user keyring of the user configured with User= is linked into
	// it, so that keys assigned to the user may be requested by the unit's processes. In this mode multiple units running processes
	// under the same user ID may share key material. Unless inherit is selected the unique invocation ID for the unit (see below)
	// is added as a protected key by the name "invocation_id" to the newly created session keyring. Defaults to private for services
	// of the system service manager and to inherit for non-service units and for services of the user service manager.
	//
	// Added in version 235.
	KeyringMode systemdconf.Value

	// Sets the adjustment value for the Linux kernel's Out-Of-Memory (OOM) killer score for executed processes. Takes an integer
	// between -1000 (to disable OOM killing of processes of this unit) and 1000 (to make killing of processes of this unit under
	// memory pressure very likely). See The /proc Filesystem for details. If not specified defaults to the OOM score adjustment
	// level of the service manager itself, which is normally at 0.
	//
	// Use the OOMPolicy= setting of service units to configure how the service manager shall react to the kernel OOM killer or
	// systemd-oomd terminating a process of the service. See systemd.service for details.
	OOMScoreAdjust systemdconf.Value

	// Sets the timer slack in nanoseconds for the executed processes. The timer slack controls the accuracy of wake-ups triggered
	// by timers. See prctl for more information. Note that in contrast to most other time span definitions this parameter takes
	// an integer value in nano-seconds if no unit is specified. The usual time units are understood too.
	TimerSlackNSec systemdconf.Value

	// Controls which kernel architecture uname shall report, when invoked by unit processes. Takes one of the architecture
	// identifiers arm64, arm64-be, arm, arm-be, x86, x86-64, ppc, ppc-le, ppc64, ppc64-le, s390 or s390x. Which personality
	// architectures are supported depends on the kernel's native architecture. Usually the 64-bit versions of the various
	// system architectures support their immediate 32-bit personality architecture counterpart, but no others. For example,
	// x86-64 systems support the x86-64 and x86 personalities but no others. The personality feature is useful when running
	// 32-bit services on a 64-bit host system. If not specified, the personality is left unmodified and thus reflects the personality
	// of the host system's kernel. This option is not useful on architectures for which only one native word width was ever available,
	// such as m68k (32-bit only) or alpha (64-bit only).
	//
	// Added in version 209.
	Personality systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. If true, SIGPIPE is ignored in the executed process. Defaults to true since SIGPIPE is generally
	// only useful in shell pipelines.
	IgnoreSIGPIPE systemdconf.Value

	// Sets the default nice level (scheduling priority) for executed processes. Takes an integer between -20 (highest priority)
	// and 19 (lowest priority). In case of resource contention, smaller values mean more resources will be made available to
	// the unit's processes, larger values mean less resources will be made available. See setpriority for details.
	Nice systemdconf.Value

	// Sets the CPU scheduling policy for executed processes. Takes one of other, batch, idle, fifo or rr. See sched_setscheduler
	// for details.
	CPUSchedulingPolicy systemdconf.Value

	// Sets the CPU scheduling priority for executed processes. The available priority range depends on the selected CPU scheduling
	// policy (see above). For real-time scheduling policies an integer between 1 (lowest priority) and 99 (highest priority)
	// can be used. In case of CPU resource contention, smaller values mean less CPU time is made available to the service, larger
	// values mean more. See sched_setscheduler for details.
	CPUSchedulingPriority systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. If true, elevated CPU scheduling priorities and policies will be reset when the executed processes
	// call fork, and can hence not leak into child processes. See sched_setscheduler for details. Defaults to false.
	CPUSchedulingResetOnFork systemdconf.Value

	// Controls the CPU affinity of the executed processes. Takes a list of CPU indices or ranges separated by either whitespace
	// or commas. Alternatively, takes a special "numa" value in which case systemd automatically derives allowed CPU range
	// based on the value of NUMAMask= option. CPU ranges are specified by the lower and upper CPU indices separated by a dash. This
	// option may be specified more than once, in which case the specified CPU affinity masks are merged. If the empty string is
	// assigned, the mask is reset, all assignments prior to this will have no effect. See sched_setaffinity for details.
	CPUAffinity systemdconf.Value

	// Controls the NUMA memory policy of the executed processes. Takes a policy type, one of: default, preferred, bind, interleave
	// and local. A list of NUMA nodes that should be associated with the policy must be specified in NUMAMask=. For more details
	// on each policy please see, set_mempolicy. For overall overview of NUMA support in Linux see, numa.
	//
	// Added in version 243.
	NUMAPolicy systemdconf.Value

	// Controls the NUMA node list which will be applied alongside with selected NUMA policy. Takes a list of NUMA nodes and has
	// the same syntax as a list of CPUs for CPUAffinity= option or special "all" value which will include all available NUMA nodes
	// in the mask. Note that the list of NUMA nodes is not required for default and local policies and for preferred policy we expect
	// a single NUMA node.
	//
	// Added in version 243.
	NUMAMask systemdconf.Value

	// Sets the I/O scheduling class for executed processes. Takes one of the strings realtime, best-effort or idle. The kernel's
	// default scheduling class is best-effort at a priority of 4. If the empty string is assigned to this option, all prior assignments
	// to both IOSchedulingClass= and IOSchedulingPriority= have no effect. See ioprio_set for details.
	IOSchedulingClass systemdconf.Value

	// Sets the I/O scheduling priority for executed processes. Takes an integer between 0 (highest priority) and 7 (lowest priority).
	// In case of I/O contention, smaller values mean more I/O bandwidth is made available to the unit's processes, larger values
	// mean less bandwidth. The available priorities depend on the selected I/O scheduling class (see above). If the empty string
	// is assigned to this option, all prior assignments to both IOSchedulingClass= and IOSchedulingPriority= have no effect.
	// For the kernel's default scheduling class (best-effort) this defaults to 4. See ioprio_set for details.
	IOSchedulingPriority systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument or the special values "full" or "strict". If true, mounts the /usr/ and the boot loader directories
	// (/boot and /efi) read-only for processes invoked by this unit. If set to "full", the /etc/ directory is mounted read-only,
	// too. If set to "strict" the entire file system hierarchy is mounted read-only, except for the API file system subtrees /dev/,
	// /proc/ and /sys/ (protect these directories using PrivateDevices=, ProtectKernelTunables=, ProtectControlGroups=).
	// This setting ensures that any modification of the vendor-supplied operating system (and optionally its configuration,
	// and local mounts) is prohibited for the service. It is recommended to enable this setting for all long-running services,
	// unless they are involved with system updates or need to modify the operating system in other ways. If this option is used,
	// ReadWritePaths= may be used to exclude specific directories from being made read-only. Similar, StateDirectory=, LogsDirectory=,
	// â€¦ and related directory settings (see below) also exclude the specific directories from the effect of ProtectSystem=.
	// This setting is implied if DynamicUser= is set. This setting cannot ensure protection in all cases. In general it has the
	// same limitations as ReadOnlyPaths=, see below. Defaults to off.
	//
	// Note that if ProtectSystem= is set to "strict" and PrivateTmp= is enabled, then /tmp/ and /var/tmp/ will be writable.
	//
	// Added in version 214.
	ProtectSystem systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument or the special values "read-only" or "tmpfs". If true, the directories /home/, /root, and /run/user
	// are made inaccessible and empty for processes invoked by this unit. If set to "read-only", the three directories are made
	// read-only instead. If set to "tmpfs", temporary file systems are mounted on the three directories in read-only mode. The
	// value "tmpfs" is useful to hide home directories not relevant to the processes invoked by the unit, while still allowing
	// necessary directories to be made visible when listed in BindPaths= or BindReadOnlyPaths=.
	//
	// Setting this to "yes" is mostly equivalent to setting the three directories in InaccessiblePaths=. Similarly, "read-only"
	// is mostly equivalent to ReadOnlyPaths=, and "tmpfs" is mostly equivalent to TemporaryFileSystem= with ":ro".
	//
	// It is recommended to enable this setting for all long-running services (in particular network-facing ones), to ensure
	// they cannot get access to private user data, unless the services actually require access to the user's private data. This
	// setting is implied if DynamicUser= is set. This setting cannot ensure protection in all cases. In general it has the same
	// limitations as ReadOnlyPaths=, see below.
	//
	// This option is only available for system services, or for services running in per-user instances of the service manager
	// in which case PrivateUsers= is implicitly enabled (requires unprivileged user namespaces support to be enabled in the
	// kernel via the "kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=" sysctl).
	//
	// Added in version 214.
	ProtectHome systemdconf.Value

	// These options take a whitespace-separated list of directory names. The specified directory names must be relative, and
	// may not include "..". If set, when the unit is started, one or more directories by the specified names will be created (including
	// their parents) below the locations defined in the following table. Also, the corresponding environment variable will
	// be defined with the full paths of the directories. If multiple directories are set, then in the environment variable the
	// paths are concatenated with colon (":").
	//
	// If DynamicUser= is used, and if the kernel version supports id-mapped mounts, the specified directories will be owned
	// by "nobody" in the host namespace and will be mapped to (and will be owned by) the service's UID/GID in its own namespace.
	// For backward compatibility, existing directories created without id-mapped mounts will be kept untouched.

	// In case of RuntimeDirectory= the innermost subdirectories are removed when the unit is stopped. It is possible to preserve
	// the specified directories in this case if RuntimeDirectoryPreserve= is configured to restart or yes (see below). The
	// directories specified with StateDirectory=, CacheDirectory=, LogsDirectory=, ConfigurationDirectory= are not
	// removed when the unit is stopped.
	//
	// Except in case of ConfigurationDirectory=, the innermost specified directories will be owned by the user and group specified
	// in User= and Group=. If the specified directories already exist and their owning user or group do not match the configured
	// ones, all files and directories below the specified directories as well as the directories themselves will have their
	// file ownership recursively changed to match what is configured. As an optimization, if the specified directories are
	// already owned by the right user and group, files and directories below of them are left as-is, even if they do not match what
	// is requested. The innermost specified directories will have their access mode adjusted to the what is specified in RuntimeDirectoryMode=,
	// StateDirectoryMode=, CacheDirectoryMode=, LogsDirectoryMode= and ConfigurationDirectoryMode=.
	//
	// These options imply BindPaths= for the specified paths. When combined with RootDirectory= or RootImage= these paths
	// always reside on the host and are mounted from there into the unit's file system namespace.
	//
	// If DynamicUser= is used, the logic for CacheDirectory=, LogsDirectory= and StateDirectory= is slightly altered: the
	// directories are created below /var/cache/private, /var/log/private and /var/lib/private, respectively, which are
	// host directories made inaccessible to unprivileged users, which ensures that access to these directories cannot be gained
	// through dynamic user ID recycling. Symbolic links are created to hide this difference in behaviour. Both from perspective
	// of the host and from inside the unit, the relevant directories hence always appear directly below /var/cache, /var/log
	// and /var/lib.
	//
	// Use RuntimeDirectory= to manage one or more runtime directories for the unit and bind their lifetime to the daemon runtime.
	// This is particularly useful for unprivileged daemons that cannot create runtime directories in /run/ due to lack of privileges,
	// and to make sure the runtime directory is cleaned up automatically after use. For runtime directories that require more
	// complex or different configuration or lifetime guarantees, please consider using tmpfiles.d.
	//
	// RuntimeDirectory=, StateDirectory=, CacheDirectory= and LogsDirectory= optionally support two more parameters,
	// separated by ":". The second parameter will be interpreted as a destination path that will be created as a symlink to the
	// directory. The symlinks will be created after any BindPaths= or TemporaryFileSystem= options have been set up, to make
	// ephemeral symlinking possible. The same source can have multiple symlinks, by using the same first parameter, but a different
	// second parameter. The third parameter is a flags field, and since v257 can take a value of ro to make the directory read only
	// for the service. This is also supported for ConfigurationDirectory=. If multiple symlinks are set up, the directory will
	// be read only if at least one is configured to be read only. To pass a flag without a destination symlink, the second parameter
	// can be empty, for example:
	//
	//	ConfigurationDirectory=foo::ro
	//
	// The directories defined by these options are always created under the standard paths used by systemd (/var/, /run/, /etc/,
	// â€¦). If the service needs directories in a different location, a different mechanism has to be used to create them.
	//
	// tmpfiles.d provides functionality that overlaps with these options. Using these options is recommended, because the
	// lifetime of the directories is tied directly to the lifetime of the unit, and it is not necessary to ensure that the tmpfiles.d
	// configuration is executed before the unit is started.
	//
	// To remove any of the directories created by these settings, use the systemctl clean â€¦ command on the relevant units, see
	// systemctl for details.
	//
	// Example: if a system service unit has the following,
	//
	//	RuntimeDirectory=foo/bar baz
	//
	// the service manager creates /run/foo (if it does not exist), /run/foo/bar, and /run/baz. The directories /run/foo/bar
	// and /run/baz except /run/foo are owned by the user and group specified in User= and Group=, and removed when the service
	// is stopped.
	//
	// Example: if a system service unit has the following,
	//
	//	RuntimeDirectory=foo/bar StateDirectory=aaa/bbb ccc
	//
	// then the environment variable "RUNTIME_DIRECTORY" is set with "/run/foo/bar", and "STATE_DIRECTORY" is set with "/var/lib/aaa/bbb:/var/lib/ccc".
	//
	// Example: if a system service unit has the following,
	//
	//	RuntimeDirectory=foo:bar foo:baz
	//
	// the service manager creates /run/foo (if it does not exist), and /run/bar plus /run/baz as symlinks to /run/foo.

	// as /dev/null, /dev/zero or /dev/random (as well as the pseudo TTY subsystem) to it, but no physical devices such as /dev/sda,
	// system memory /dev/mem, system ports /dev/port and others. This is useful to turn off physical device access by the executed
	// process. Defaults to false.
	//
	// Enabling this option will install a system call filter to block low-level I/O system calls that are grouped in the @raw-io
	// set, remove CAP_MKNOD and CAP_SYS_RAWIO from the capability bounding set for the unit, and set DevicePolicy=closed (see
	// systemd.resource-control for details). Note that using this setting will disconnect propagation of mounts from the
	// service to the host (propagation in the opposite direction continues to work). This means that this setting may not be used
	// for services which shall be able to install mount points in the main mount namespace. The new /dev/ will be mounted read-only
	// and 'noexec'. The latter may break old programs which try to set up executable memory by using mmap of /dev/zero instead
	// of using MAP_ANON. For this setting the same restrictions regarding mount propagation and privileges apply as for ReadOnlyPaths=
	// and related calls, see above.
	//
	// Note that the implementation of this setting might be impossible (for example if mount namespaces are not available),
	// and the unit should be written in a way that does not solely rely on this setting for security.

	// When access to some but not all devices must be possible, the DeviceAllow= setting might be used instead. See systemd.resource-control.
	//
	// Added in version 209.
	PrivateDevices systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. If true, sets up a new network namespace for the executed processes and configures only the loopback
	// network device "lo" inside it. No other network devices will be available to the executed process. This is useful to turn
	// off network access by the executed process. Defaults to false. It is possible to run two or more units within the same private
	// network namespace by using the JoinsNamespaceOf= directive, see systemd.unit for details. Note that this option will
	// disconnect all socket families from the host, including AF_NETLINK and AF_UNIX. Effectively, for AF_NETLINK this means
	// that device configuration events received from systemd-udevd.service are not delivered to the unit's processes. And
	// for AF_UNIX this has the effect that AF_UNIX sockets in the abstract socket namespace of the host will become unavailable
	// to the unit's processes (however, those located in the file system will continue to be accessible).
	//
	// Note that the implementation of this setting might be impossible (for example if network namespaces are not available),
	// and the unit should be written in a way that does not solely rely on this setting for security.
	//
	// When this option is enabled, PrivateMounts= is implied unless it is explicitly disabled, and /sys will be remounted to
	// associate it with the new network namespace.
	//
	// When this option is used on a socket unit any sockets bound on behalf of this unit will be bound within a private network namespace.
	// This may be combined with JoinsNamespaceOf= to listen on sockets inside of network namespaces of other services.

	PrivateNetwork systemdconf.Value

	// Takes an absolute file system path referring to a Linux network namespace pseudo-file (i.e. a file like /proc/$PID/ns/net

	//
	// Added in version 242.
	NetworkNamespacePath systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. If true, sets up a new IPC namespace for the executed processes. Each IPC namespace has its own
	// set of System V IPC identifiers and its own POSIX message queue file system. This is useful to avoid name clash of IPC identifiers.
	// Defaults to false. It is possible to run two or more units within the same private IPC namespace by using the JoinsNamespaceOf=
	// directive, see systemd.unit for details.
	//
	// Note that IPC namespacing does not have an effect on AF_UNIX sockets, which are the most common form of IPC used on Linux.
	// Instead, AF_UNIX sockets in the file system are subject to mount namespacing, and those in the abstract namespace are subject
	// to network namespacing. IPC namespacing only has an effect on SysV IPC (which is mostly legacy) as well as POSIX message
	// queues (for which AF_UNIX/SOCK_SEQPACKET sockets are typically a better replacement). IPC namespacing also has no effect
	// on POSIX shared memory (which is subject to mount namespacing) either. See ipc_namespaces for the details.

	IPCNamespacePath systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. When set, it enables KSM (kernel samepage merging) for the processes. KSM is a memory-saving
	// de-duplication feature. Anonymous memory pages with identical content can be replaced by a single write-protected page.
	// This feature should only be enabled for jobs that share the same security domain. For details, see Kernel Samepage Merging
	// in the kernel documentation.
	//
	// Note that this functionality might not be available, for example if KSM is disabled in the kernel, or the kernel does not
	// support controlling KSM at the process level through prctl.
	//
	// Added in version 254.
	MemoryKSM systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. Defaults to false. If enabled, sets up a new PID namespace for the executed processes. Each executed
	// process is now PID 1 - the init process - in the new namespace. /proc/ is mounted such that only processes in the PID namespace
	// are visible. If PrivatePIDs= is set, MountAPIVFS=yes is implied.
	//
	// PrivatePIDs= is only supported for service units. This setting is not supported with Type=forking since the kernel will
	// kill all processes in the PID namespace if the init process terminates.
	//
	// This setting will be ignored if the kernel does not support PID namespaces.
	//
	// Note unprivileged user services (i.e. a service run by the per-user instance of the service manager) will fail with PrivatePIDs=yes
	// if /proc/ is masked (i.e. /proc/kmsg is over-mounted with tmpfs like systemd-nspawn does). This is due to a kernel restriction
	// not allowing unprivileged user namespaces to mount a less restrictive instance of /proc/.
	//
	// Added in version 257.
	PrivatePIDs systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument or one of "self" or "identity". Defaults to false. If enabled, sets up a new user namespace for the
	// executed processes and configures a user and group mapping. If set to a true value or "self", a minimal user and group mapping
	// is configured that maps the "root" user and group as well as the unit's own user and group to themselves and everything else
	// to the "nobody" user and group. This is useful to securely detach the user and group databases used by the unit from the rest
	// of the system, and thus to create an effective sandbox environment. All files, directories, processes, IPC objects and
	// other resources owned by users/groups not equaling "root" or the unit's own will stay visible from within the unit but appear
	// owned by the "nobody" user and group.
	//
	// If the parameter is "identity", user namespacing is set up with an identity mapping for the first 65536 UIDs/GIDs. Any UIDs/GIDs
	// above 65536 will be mapped to the "nobody" user and group, respectively. While this does not provide UID/GID isolation,
	// since all UIDs/GIDs are chosen identically it does provide process capability isolation, and hence is often a good choice
	// if proper user namespacing with distinct UID maps is not appropriate.
	//
	// If this mode is enabled, all unit processes are run without privileges in the host user namespace (regardless if the unit's
	// own user/group is "root" or not). Specifically this means that the process will have zero process capabilities on the host's
	// user namespace, but full capabilities within the service's user namespace. Settings such as CapabilityBoundingSet=
	// will affect only the latter, and there's no way to acquire additional capabilities in the host's user namespace.
	//
	// When this setting is set up by a per-user instance of the service manager, the mapping of the "root" user and group to itself
	// is omitted (unless the user manager is root). Additionally, in the per-user instance manager case, the user namespace
	// will be set up before most other namespaces. This means that combining PrivateUsers=true with other namespaces will enable
	// use of features not normally supported by the per-user instances of the service manager.
	//
	// This setting is particularly useful in conjunction with RootDirectory=/RootImage=, as the need to synchronize the user
	// and group databases in the root directory and on the host is reduced, as the only users and groups who need to be matched are
	// "root", "nobody" and the unit's own user and group.
	//
	// Note that the implementation of this setting might be impossible (for example if user namespaces are not available), and
	// the unit should be written in a way that does not solely rely on this setting for security.
	//
	// Added in version 232.
	PrivateUsers systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. When set, sets up a new UTS namespace for the executed processes. In addition, changing hostname
	// or domainname is prevented. Defaults to off.
	//
	// Note that the implementation of this setting might be impossible (for example if UTS namespaces are not available), and
	// the unit should be written in a way that does not solely rely on this setting for security.
	//
	// Note that when this option is enabled for a service hostname changes no longer propagate from the system into the service,
	// it is hence not suitable for services that need to take notice of system hostname changes dynamically.
	//
	// This option is only available for system services, or for services running in per-user instances of the service manager
	// in which case PrivateUsers= is implicitly enabled (requires unprivileged user namespaces support to be enabled in the

	//
	// Added in version 242.
	ProtectHostname systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. If set, writes to the hardware clock or system clock will be denied. Defaults to off. Enabling
	// this option removes CAP_SYS_TIME and CAP_WAKE_ALARM from the capability bounding set for this unit, installs a system
	// call filter to block calls that can set the clock, and DeviceAllow=char-rtc r is implied. Note that the system calls are
	// blocked altogether, the filter does not take into account that some of the calls can be used to read the clock state with some
	// parameter combinations. Effectively, /dev/rtc0, /dev/rtc1, etc. are made read-only to the service. See systemd.resource-control
	// for the details about DeviceAllow=.
	//
	// It is recommended to turn this on for most services that do not need modify the clock or check its state.

	// this on for most services. For this setting the same restrictions regarding mount propagation and privileges apply as
	// for ReadOnlyPaths= and related calls, see above. Defaults to off. Note that this option does not prevent indirect changes
	// to kernel tunables affected by IPC calls to other processes. However, InaccessiblePaths= may be used to make relevant
	// IPC file system objects inaccessible. If ProtectKernelTunables= is set, MountAPIVFS=yes is implied.

	ProtectKernelTunables systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. If true, explicit module loading will be denied. This allows module load and unload operations
	// to be turned off on modular kernels. It is recommended to turn this on for most services that do not need special file systems
	// or extra kernel modules to work. Defaults to off. Enabling this option removes CAP_SYS_MODULE from the capability bounding
	// set for the unit, and installs a system call filter to block module system calls, also /usr/lib/modules is made inaccessible.
	// For this setting the same restrictions regarding mount propagation and privileges apply as for ReadOnlyPaths= and related

	//
	// Added in version 232.
	ProtectKernelModules systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. If true, access to the kernel log ring buffer will be denied. It is recommended to turn this on for
	// most services that do not need to read from or write to the kernel log ring buffer. Enabling this option removes CAP_SYSLOG
	// from the capability bounding set for this unit, and installs a system call filter to block the syslog system call (not to
	// be confused with the libc API syslog for userspace logging). The kernel exposes its log buffer to userspace via /dev/kmsg

	ProtectKernelLogs systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument or the special values "private" or "strict". If true, the Linux Control Groups (cgroups) hierarchies

	// run in a cgroup namespace with a private writable mount of /sys/fs/cgroup/. If set to "strict", the unit will run in a cgroup
	// namespace with a private read-only mount of /sys/fs/cgroup/. Defaults to off. If ProtectControlGroups= is set, MountAPIVFS=yes
	// is implied. Note "private" and "strict" are downgraded to false and true respectively unless the system is using the unified
	// control group hierarchy and the kernel supports cgroup namespaces.
	//
	// Except for container managers no services should require write access to the control groups hierarchies; it is hence recommended

	// Restricts the set of socket address families accessible to the processes of this unit. Takes "none", or a space-separated

	//
	// By default, no restrictions apply, all address families are accessible to processes. If assigned the empty string, any

	//
	// Use this option to limit exposure of processes to remote access, in particular via exotic and sensitive network protocols,
	// such as AF_PACKET. Note that in most cases, the local AF_UNIX address family should be included in the configured allow
	// list as it is frequently used for local communication, including for syslog logging.
	//
	// Note that this restricts access to the socket system call only. Sockets passed into the process by other means (for example,
	// by using socket activation with socket units, see systemd.socket) are unaffected. Also, sockets created with socketpair()
	// (which creates connected AF_UNIX sockets) or the io_uring functions, are not affected. Thus, it is recommended to combined
	// this setting with SystemCallFilter=@service, to only allow a limited subset of system calls.
	//
	// Note that this option is limited to some ABIs, in particular x86-64, but currently has no effect on 32-bit x86, s390, s390x,
	// mips, mips-le, ppc, ppc-le, ppc64, or ppc64-le, and is ignored. On systems supporting multiple ABIs (such as x86/x86-64)

	RestrictAddressFamilies systemdconf.Value

	// Restricts the set of filesystems processes of this unit can open files on. Takes a space-separated list of filesystem names.

	//
	// Example: if a unit has the following,

	// mmap system calls with both PROT_EXEC and PROT_WRITE set, mprotect or pkey_mprotect system calls with PROT_EXEC set and
	// shmat system calls with SHM_EXEC set. Note that this option is incompatible with programs and libraries that generate
	// program code dynamically at runtime, including JIT execution engines, executable stacks, and code "trampoline" feature
	// of various C compilers. This option improves service security, as it makes harder for software exploits to change running
	// code dynamically. However, the protection can be circumvented, if the service can write to a filesystem, which is not mounted
	// with noexec (such as /dev/shm), or it can use memfd_create(). This can be prevented by making such file systems inaccessible
	// to the service (e.g. InaccessiblePaths=/dev/shm) and installing further system call filters (SystemCallFilter=~memfd_create).
	// Note that this feature is fully available on x86-64, and partially on x86. Specifically, the shmat() protection is not
	// available on x86. Note that on systems supporting multiple ABIs (such as x86/x86-64) it is recommended to turn off alternative
	// ABIs for services, so that they cannot be used to circumvent the restrictions of this option. Specifically, it is recommended
	// to combine this option with SystemCallArchitectures=native or similar.
	//
	// Added in version 231.
	MemoryDenyWriteExecute systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. If set, any attempts to enable realtime scheduling in a process of the unit are refused. This restricts
	// access to realtime task scheduling policies such as SCHED_FIFO, SCHED_RR or SCHED_DEADLINE. See sched for details about
	// these scheduling policies. Realtime scheduling policies may be used to monopolize CPU time for longer periods of time,
	// and may hence be used to lock up or otherwise trigger Denial-of-Service situations on the system. It is hence recommended
	// to restrict access to realtime scheduling to the few programs that actually require them. Defaults to off.
	//
	// Added in version 231.
	RestrictRealtime systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. If set, any attempts to set the set-user-ID (SUID) or set-group-ID (SGID) bits on files or directories
	// will be denied (for details on these bits see inode). As the SUID/SGID bits are mechanisms to elevate privileges, and allow
	// users to acquire the identity of other users, it is recommended to restrict creation of SUID/SGID files to the few programs
	// that actually require them. Note that this restricts marking of any type of file system object with these bits, including
	// both regular files and directories (where the SGID is a different meaning than for files, see documentation). This option
	// is implied if DynamicUser= is enabled. Defaults to off.
	//
	// Added in version 242.
	RestrictSUIDSGID systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean parameter. If set, all System V and POSIX IPC objects owned by the user and group the processes of this unit
	// are run as are removed when the unit is stopped. This setting only has an effect if at least one of User=, Group= and DynamicUser=
	// are used. It has no effect on IPC objects owned by the root user. Specifically, this removes System V semaphores, as well
	// as System V and POSIX shared memory segments and message queues. If multiple units use the same user or group the IPC objects
	// are removed when the last of these units is stopped. This setting is implied if DynamicUser= is set.
	//
	// This option is only available for system services and is not supported for services running in per-user instances of the
	// service manager.
	//
	// Added in version 232.
	RemoveIPC systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean parameter. If set, the processes of this unit will be run in their own private file system (mount) namespace
	// with all mount propagation from the processes towards the host's main file system namespace turned off. This means any
	// file system mount points established or removed by the unit's processes will be private to them and not be visible to the
	// host. However, file system mount points established or removed on the host will be propagated to the unit's processes.
	// See mount_namespaces for details on file system namespaces. Defaults to off.
	//
	// When turned on, this executes three operations for each invoked process: a new CLONE_NEWNS namespace is created, after
	// which all existing mounts are remounted to MS_SLAVE to disable propagation from the unit's processes to the host (but leaving
	// propagation in the opposite direction in effect). Finally, the mounts are remounted again to the propagation mode configured
	// with MountFlags=, see below.
	//
	// File system namespaces are set up individually for each process forked off by the service manager. Mounts established
	// in the namespace of the process created by ExecStartPre= will hence be cleaned up automatically as soon as that process
	// exits and will not be available to subsequent processes forked off for ExecStart= (and similar applies to the various other
	// commands configured for units). Similarly, JoinsNamespaceOf= does not permit sharing kernel mount namespaces between
	// units, it only enables sharing of the /tmp/ and /var/tmp/ directories.
	//
	// Other file system namespace unit settings â€” PrivateTmp=, PrivateDevices=, ProtectSystem=, ProtectHome=, ReadOnlyPaths=,
	// InaccessiblePaths=, ReadWritePaths=, BindPaths=, BindReadOnlyPaths=, â€¦ â€” also enable file system namespacing in
	// a fashion equivalent to this option. Hence it is primarily useful to explicitly request this behaviour if none of the other
	// settings are used.
	//
	// This option is only available for system services, or for services running in per-user instances of the service manager
	// in which case PrivateUsers= is implicitly enabled (requires unprivileged user namespaces support to be enabled in the
	// kernel via the "kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=" sysctl).
	//
	// Added in version 239.
	PrivateMounts systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a mount propagation setting: shared, slave or private, which controls whether file system mount points in the file
	// system namespaces set up for this unit's processes will receive or propagate mounts and unmounts from other file system
	// namespaces. See mount for details on mount propagation, and the three propagation flags in particular.
	//
	// This setting only controls the final propagation setting in effect on all mount points of the file system namespace created
	// for each process of this unit. Other file system namespacing unit settings (see the discussion in PrivateMounts= above)
	// will implicitly disable mount and unmount propagation from the unit's processes towards the host by changing the propagation
	// setting of all mount points in the unit's file system namespace to slave first. Setting this option to shared does not reestablish
	// propagation in that case.
	//
	// If not set â€“ but file system namespaces are enabled through another file system namespace unit setting â€“ shared mount propagation
	// is used, but â€” as mentioned â€” as slave is applied first, propagation from the unit's processes to the host is still turned
	// off.
	//
	// It is not recommended to use private mount propagation for units, as this means temporary mounts (such as removable media)
	// of the host will stay mounted and thus indefinitely busy in forked off processes, as unmount propagation events will not
	// be received by the file system namespace of the unit.
	//
	// Usually, it is best to leave this setting unmodified, and use higher level file system namespacing options instead, in
	// particular PrivateMounts=, see above.
	//
	// This option is only available for system services, or for services running in per-user instances of the service manager
	// in which case PrivateUsers= is implicitly enabled (requires unprivileged user namespaces support to be enabled in the
	// kernel via the "kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=" sysctl).
	MountFlags systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a space-separated list of system call names or system call groups. If this setting is used, system calls executed
	// by the unit processes except for the listed ones will result in the system call being denied (allow-listing). If the first
	// character of the list is "~", the effect is inverted: only the listed system calls will be denied (deny-listing). This option
	// may be specified more than once, in which case the filter masks are merged. If the empty string is assigned, the filter is
	// reset, all prior assignments will have no effect.
	//
	// Commands prefixed with "+" are not subject to filtering. The execve(), exit(), exit_group(), getrlimit(), rt_sigreturn(),
	// sigreturn() system calls and the system calls for querying time and sleeping are implicitly allow-listed and do not need
	// to be listed explicitly.
	//
	// The default action when a system call is denied is to terminate the processes with a SIGSYS signal. This can changed using
	// SystemCallErrorNumber=, see below. In addition, deny-listed system calls and system call groups may optionally be suffixed
	// with a colon (":") and an argument in the same format as SystemCallErrorNumber=, to take this action when the matching system
	// call is made. This takes precedence over the action specified in SystemCallErrorNumber=.
	//
	// This feature makes use of the Secure Computing Mode 2 interfaces of the kernel ('seccomp filtering') and is useful for enforcing
	// a minimal sandboxing environment.
	//
	// Note that on systems supporting multiple ABIs (such as x86/x86-64) it is recommended to turn off alternative ABIs for services,
	// so that they cannot be used to circumvent the restrictions of this option. Specifically, it is recommended to combine this
	// option with SystemCallArchitectures=native or similar.
	//
	// Note that strict system call filters may impact execution and error handling code paths of the service invocation. Specifically,
	// access to the execve() system call is required for the execution of the service binary â€” if it is blocked service invocation
	// will necessarily fail. Also, if execution of the service binary fails for some reason (for example: missing service executable),
	// the error handling logic might require access to an additional set of system calls in order to process and log this failure
	// correctly. It might be necessary to temporarily disable system call filters in order to allow debugging of such failures.
	//
	// If you specify both types of this option (i.e. allow-listing and deny-listing), the first encountered will take precedence
	// and will dictate the default action (termination or approval of a system call). Then the next occurrences of this option
	// will add or delete the listed system calls from the set of the filtered system calls, depending of its type and the default
	// action. (For example, if you have started with an allow list rule for read() and write(), and right after it add a deny list
	// rule for write(), then write() will be removed from the set.)
	//
	// As the number of possible system calls is large, predefined groups of system calls are provided. A group starts with "@"
	// character, followed by name of the set.

	//	|                 | updated.                                                                         |
	//	+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
	//
	// Note, that as new system calls are added to the kernel, additional system calls might be added to the groups above. Contents
	// of the sets may also change between systemd versions. In addition, the list of system calls depends on the kernel version
	// and architecture for which systemd was compiled. Use systemd-analyzeÂ syscall-filter to list the actual list of system
	// calls in each filter.
	//
	// Generally, allow-listing system calls (rather than deny-listing) is the safer mode of operation. It is recommended to
	// enforce system call allow lists for all long-running system services. Specifically, the following lines are a relatively
	// safe basic choice for the majority of system services:
	//
	//	[Service] SystemCallFilter=@system-service SystemCallErrorNumber=EPERM
	//
	// Note that various kernel system calls are defined redundantly: there are multiple system calls for executing the same
	// operation. For example, the pidfd_send_signal() system call may be used to execute operations similar to what can be done
	// with the older kill() system call, hence blocking the latter without the former only provides weak protection. Since new
	// system calls are added regularly to the kernel as development progresses, keeping system call deny lists comprehensive
	// requires constant work. It is thus recommended to use allow-listing instead, which offers the benefit that new system
	// calls are by default implicitly blocked until the allow list is updated.
	//
	// Also note that a number of system calls are required to be accessible for the dynamic linker to work. The dynamic linker is
	// required for running most regular programs (specifically: all dynamic ELF binaries, which is how most distributions
	// build packaged programs). This means that blocking these system calls (which include open(), openat() or mmap()) will
	// make most programs typically shipped with generic distributions unusable.
	//
	// It is recommended to combine the file system namespacing related options with SystemCallFilter=~@mount, in order to
	// prohibit the unit's processes to undo the mappings. Specifically these are the options PrivateTmp=, PrivateDevices=,
	// ProtectSystem=, ProtectHome=, ProtectKernelTunables=, ProtectControlGroups=, ProtectKernelLogs=, ProtectClock=,
	// ReadOnlyPaths=, InaccessiblePaths= and ReadWritePaths=.
	//
	// Added in version 187.
	SystemCallFilter systemdconf.Value

	// Takes an "errno" error number (between 1 and 4095) or errno name such as EPERM, EACCES or EUCLEAN, to return when the system
	// call filter configured with SystemCallFilter= is triggered, instead of terminating the process immediately. See errno
	// for a full list of error codes. When this setting is not used, or when the empty string or the special setting "kill" is assigned,
	// the process will be terminated immediately when the filter is triggered.
	//
	// Added in version 209.
	SystemCallErrorNumber systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a space-separated list of architecture identifiers to include in the system call filter. The known architecture
	// identifiers are the same as for ConditionArchitecture= described in systemd.unit, as well as x32, mips64-n32, mips64-le-n32,
	// and the special identifier native. The special identifier native implicitly maps to the native architecture of the system
	// (or more precisely: to the architecture the system manager is compiled for). By default, this option is set to the empty
	// list, i.e. no filtering is applied.
	//
	// If this setting is used, processes of this unit will only be permitted to call native system calls, and system calls of the
	// specified architectures. For the purposes of this option, the x32 architecture is treated as including x86-64 system
	// calls. However, this setting still fulfills its purpose, as explained below, on x32.
	//
	// System call filtering is not equally effective on all architectures. For example, on x86 filtering of network socket-related
	// calls is not possible, due to ABI limitations â€” a limitation that x86-64 does not have, however. On systems supporting multiple
	// ABIs at the same time â€” such as x86/x86-64 â€” it is hence recommended to limit the set of permitted system call architectures
	// so that secondary ABIs may not be used to circumvent the restrictions applied to the native ABI of the system. In particular,
	// setting SystemCallArchitectures=native is a good choice for disabling non-native ABIs.
	//
	// System call architectures may also be restricted system-wide via the SystemCallArchitectures= option in the global
	// configuration. See systemd-system.conf for details.
	//
	// Added in version 209.
	SystemCallArchitectures systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a space-separated list of system call names. If this setting is used, all system calls executed by the unit processes
	// for the listed ones will be logged. If the first character of the list is "~", the effect is inverted: all system calls except
	// the listed system calls will be logged. This feature makes use of the Secure Computing Mode 2 interfaces of the kernel ('seccomp
	// filtering') and is useful for auditing or setting up a minimal sandboxing environment. This option may be specified more
	// than once, in which case the filter masks are merged. If the empty string is assigned, the filter is reset, all prior assignments
	// will have no effect. This does not affect commands prefixed with "+".
	//
	// Added in version 247.
	SystemCallLog systemdconf.Value

	// Sets environment variables for executed processes. Each line is unquoted using the rules described in "Quoting" section
	// in systemd.syntax and becomes a list of variable assignments. If you need to assign a value containing spaces or the equals
	// sign to a variable, put quotes around the whole assignment. Variable expansion is not performed inside the strings and
	// the "$" character has no special meaning. Specifier expansion is performed, see the "Specifiers" section in systemd.unit.
	//
	// This option may be specified more than once, in which case all listed variables will be set. If the same variable is listed
	// twice, the later setting will override the earlier setting. If the empty string is assigned to this option, the list of environment
	// variables is reset, all prior assignments have no effect.
	//
	// The names of the variables can contain ASCII letters, digits, and the underscore character. Variable names cannot be empty
	// or start with a digit. In variable values, most characters are allowed, but non-printable characters are currently rejected.
	//
	// Example:
	//
	//	Environment="VAR1=word1 word2" VAR2=word3 "VAR3=$word 5 6"
	//
	// gives three variables "VAR1", "VAR2", "VAR3" with the values "word1 word2", "word3", "$word 5 6".
	//
	// See environ for details about environment variables.
	//
	// Note that environment variables are not suitable for passing secrets (such as passwords, key material, â€¦) to service processes.
	// Environment variables set for a unit are exposed to unprivileged clients via D-Bus IPC, and generally not understood as
	// being data that requires protection. Moreover, environment variables are propagated down the process tree, including
	// across security boundaries (such as setuid/setgid executables), and hence might leak to processes that should not have
	// access to the secret data. Use LoadCredential=, LoadCredentialEncrypted= or SetCredentialEncrypted= (see below)
	// to pass data to unit processes securely.
	Environment systemdconf.Value

	// Similar to Environment=, but reads the environment variables from a text file. The text file should contain newline-separated
	// variable assignments. Empty lines, lines without an "=" separator, or lines starting with ";" or "#" will be ignored, which
	// may be used for commenting. The file must be encoded with UTF-8. Valid characters are unicode scalar values other than unicode
	// noncharacters, U+0000 NUL, and U+FEFF unicode byte order mark. Control codes other than NUL are allowed.
	//
	// In the file, an unquoted value after the "=" is parsed with the same backslash-escape rules as POSIX shell unquoted text,
	// but unlike in a shell, interior whitespace is preserved and quotes after the first non-whitespace character are preserved.
	// Leading and trailing whitespace (space, tab, carriage return) is discarded, but interior whitespace within the line
	// is preserved verbatim. A line ending with a backslash will be continued to the following one, with the newline itself discarded.
	// A backslash "\" followed by any character other than newline will preserve the following character, so that "\\" will become
	// the value "\".
	//
	// In the file, a "'"-quoted value after the "=" can span multiple lines and contain any character verbatim other than single
	// quote, like POSIX shell single-quoted text. No backslash-escape sequences are recognized. Leading and trailing whitespace
	// outside of the single quotes is discarded.
	//
	// In the file, a """-quoted value after the "=" can span multiple lines, and the same escape sequences are recognized as in
	// POSIX shell double-quoted text. Backslash ("\") followed by any of ""\`$" will preserve that character. A backslash followed
	// by newline is a line continuation, and the newline itself is discarded. A backslash followed by any other character is ignored;
	// both the backslash and the following character are preserved verbatim. Leading and trailing whitespace outside of the
	// double quotes is discarded.
	//
	// The argument passed should be an absolute filename or wildcard expression, optionally prefixed with "-", which indicates
	// that if the file does not exist, it will not be read and no error or warning message is logged. This option may be specified
	// more than once in which case all specified files are read. If the empty string is assigned to this option, the list of file
	// to read is reset, all prior assignments have no effect.
	//
	// The files listed with this directive will be read shortly before the process is executed (more specifically, after all

	// Settings from these files override settings made with Environment=. If the same variable is set twice from these files,

	EnvironmentFile systemdconf.Value

	// Pass environment variables set for the system service manager to executed processes. Takes a space-separated list of
	// variable names. This option may be specified more than once, in which case all listed variables will be passed. If the empty
	// string is assigned to this option, the list of environment variables to pass is reset, all prior assignments have no effect.
	// Variables specified that are not set for the system manager will not be passed and will be silently ignored. Note that this
	// option is only relevant for the system service manager, as system services by default do not automatically inherit any
	// environment variables set for the service manager itself. However, in case of the user service manager all environment
	// variables are passed to the executed processes anyway, hence this option is without effect for the user service manager.
	//
	// Variables set for invoked processes due to this setting are subject to being overridden by those configured with Environment=
	// or EnvironmentFile=.
	//
	// Example:
	//
	//	PassEnvironment=VAR1 VAR2 VAR3

	PassEnvironment systemdconf.Value

	// Explicitly unset environment variable assignments that would normally be passed from the service manager to invoked

	// more than once, in which case all listed variables/assignments will be unset. If the empty string is assigned to this option,
	// the list of environment variables/assignments to unset is reset. If a variable assignment is specified (that is: a variable

	// If a variable name is specified (that is a variable name without any following "=" or value), then any assignment matching
	// the variable name, regardless of its value is removed. Note that the effect of UnsetEnvironment= is applied as final step

	//
	// Added in version 235.
	UnsetEnvironment systemdconf.Value

	// Controls where file descriptor 0 (STDIN) of the executed processes is connected to. Takes one of null, tty, tty-force,
	// tty-fail, data, file:path, socket or fd:name.
	//
	// If null is selected, standard input will be connected to /dev/null, i.e. all read attempts by the process will result in
	// immediate EOF.
	//
	// If tty is selected, standard input is connected to a TTY (as configured by TTYPath=, see below) and the executed process
	// becomes the controlling process of the terminal. If the terminal is already being controlled by another process, the executed
	// process waits until the current controlling process releases the terminal.
	//
	// tty-force is similar to tty, but the executed process is forcefully and immediately made the controlling process of the
	// terminal, potentially removing previous controlling processes from the terminal.
	//
	// tty-fail is similar to tty, but if the terminal already has a controlling process start-up of the executed process fails.
	//
	// The data option may be used to configure arbitrary textual or binary data to pass via standard input to the executed process.
	// The data to pass is configured via StandardInputText=/StandardInputData= (see below). Note that the actual file descriptor
	// type passed (memory file, regular file, UNIX pipe, â€¦) might depend on the kernel and available privileges. In any case,
	// the file descriptor is read-only, and when read returns the specified data followed by EOF.
	//
	// The file:path option may be used to connect a specific file system object to standard input. An absolute path following
	// the ":" character is expected, which may refer to a regular file, a FIFO or special file. If an AF_UNIX socket in the file system
	// is specified, a stream socket is connected to it. The latter is useful for connecting standard input of processes to arbitrary
	// system services.
	//
	// The socket option is valid in socket-activated services only, and requires the relevant socket unit file (see systemd.socket
	// for details) to have Accept=yes set, or to specify a single socket only. If this option is set, standard input will be connected
	// to the socket the service was activated from, which is primarily useful for compatibility with daemons designed for use
	// with the traditional inetd socket activation daemon ($LISTEN_FDS (and related) environment variables are not passed
	// when socket value is configured).
	//
	// The fd:name option connects standard input to a specific, named file descriptor provided by a socket unit. The name may
	// be specified as part of this option, following a ":" character (e.g. "fd:foobar"). If no name is specified, the name "stdin"
	// is implied (i.e. "fd" is equivalent to "fd:stdin"). At least one socket unit defining the specified name must be provided
	// via the Sockets= option, and the file descriptor name may differ from the name of its containing socket unit. If multiple
	// matches are found, the first one will be used. See FileDescriptorName= in systemd.socket for more details about named
	// file descriptors and their ordering.
	//
	// This setting defaults to null, unless StandardInputText=/StandardInputData= are set, in which case it defaults to data.
	StandardInput systemdconf.Value

	// Controls where file descriptor 1 (stdout) of the executed processes is connected to. Takes one of inherit, null, tty, journal,
	// kmsg, journal+console, kmsg+console, file:path, append:path, truncate:path, socket or fd:name.
	//
	// inherit duplicates the file descriptor of standard input for standard output.
	//
	// null connects standard output to /dev/null, i.e. everything written to it will be lost.
	//
	// tty connects standard output to a tty (as configured via TTYPath=, see below). If the TTY is used for output only, the executed
	// process will not become the controlling process of the terminal, and will not fail or wait for other processes to release
	// the terminal. Note: if a unit tries to print multiple lines to a TTY during bootup or shutdown, then there's a chance that
	// those lines will be broken up by status messages. SetShowStatus() can be used to prevent this problem. See org.freedesktop.systemd1
	// for details.
	//
	// journal connects standard output with the journal, which is accessible via journalctl. Note that everything that is written
	// to kmsg (see below) is implicitly stored in the journal as well, the specific option listed below is hence a superset of this
	// one. (Also note that any external, additional syslog daemons receive their log data from the journal, too, hence this is
	// the option to use when logging shall be processed with such a daemon.)
	//
	// kmsg connects standard output with the kernel log buffer which is accessible via dmesg, in addition to the journal. The
	// journal daemon might be configured to send all logs to kmsg anyway, in which case this option is no different from journal.
	//
	// journal+console and kmsg+console work in a similar way as the two options above but copy the output to the system console
	// as well.
	//
	// The file:path option may be used to connect a specific file system object to standard output. The semantics are similar
	// to the same option of StandardInput=, see above. If path refers to a regular file on the filesystem, it is opened (created
	// if it does not exist yet using privileges of the user executing the systemd process) for writing at the beginning of the file,
	// but without truncating it. If standard input and output are directed to the same file path, it is opened only once â€” for reading
	// as well as writing â€” and duplicated. This is particularly useful when the specified path refers to an AF_UNIX socket in the
	// file system, as in that case only a single stream connection is created for both input and output.
	//
	// append:path is similar to file:path above, but it opens the file in append mode.
	//
	// truncate:path is similar to file:path above, but it truncates the file when opening it. For units with multiple command
	// lines, e.g. Type=oneshot services with multiple ExecStart=, or services with ExecCondition=, ExecStartPre= or ExecStartPost=,
	// the output file is reopened and therefore re-truncated for each command line. If the output file is truncated while another
	// process still has the file open, e.g. by an ExecReload= running concurrently with an ExecStart=, and the other process
	// continues writing to the file without adjusting its offset, then the space between the file pointers of the two processes
	// may be filled with NUL bytes, producing a sparse file. Thus, truncate:path is typically only useful for units where only
	// one process runs at a time, such as services with a single ExecStart= and no ExecStartPost=, ExecReload=, ExecStop= or
	// similar.
	//
	// socket connects standard output to a socket acquired via socket activation. The semantics are similar to the same option
	// of StandardInput=, see above.
	//
	// The fd:name option connects standard output to a specific, named file descriptor provided by a socket unit. A name may be
	// specified as part of this option, following a ":" character (e.g. "fd:foobar"). If no name is specified, the name "stdout"
	// is implied (i.e. "fd" is equivalent to "fd:stdout"). At least one socket unit defining the specified name must be provided
	// via the Sockets= option, and the file descriptor name may differ from the name of its containing socket unit. If multiple
	// matches are found, the first one will be used. See FileDescriptorName= in systemd.socket for more details about named
	// descriptors and their ordering.
	//
	// If the standard output (or error output, see below) of a unit is connected to the journal or the kernel log buffer, the unit
	// will implicitly gain a dependency of type After= on systemd-journald.socket (also see the "Implicit Dependencies" section
	// above). Also note that in this case stdout (or stderr, see below) will be an AF_UNIX stream socket, and not a pipe or FIFO that
	// can be reopened. This means when executing shell scripts the construct echo "hello" > /dev/stderr for writing text to stderr
	// will not work. To mitigate this use the construct echo "hello" >&2 instead, which is mostly equivalent and avoids this pitfall.
	//
	// If StandardInput= is set to one of tty, tty-force, tty-fail, socket, or fd:name, this setting defaults to inherit.
	//
	// In other cases, this setting defaults to the value set with DefaultStandardOutput= in systemd-system.conf, which defaults
	// to journal. Note that setting this parameter might result in additional dependencies to be added to the unit (see above).
	StandardOutput systemdconf.Value

	// Controls where file descriptor 2 (stderr) of the executed processes is connected to. The available options are identical
	// to those of StandardOutput=, with some exceptions: if set to inherit the file descriptor used for standard output is duplicated
	// for standard error, while fd:name will use a default file descriptor name of "stderr".
	//
	// This setting defaults to the value set with DefaultStandardError= in systemd-system.conf, which defaults to inherit.
	// Note that setting this parameter might result in additional dependencies to be added to the unit (see above).
	StandardError systemdconf.Value

	// Configures arbitrary textual or binary data to pass via file descriptor 0 (STDIN) to the executed processes. These settings
	// have no effect unless StandardInput= is set to data (which is the default if StandardInput= is not set otherwise, but StandardInputText=/StandardInputData=
	// is). Use this option to embed process input data directly in the unit file.
	//
	// StandardInputText= accepts arbitrary textual data. C-style escapes for special characters as well as the usual "%"-specifiers
	// are resolved. Each time this setting is used the specified text is appended to the per-unit data buffer, followed by a newline
	// character (thus every use appends a new line to the end of the buffer). Note that leading and trailing whitespace of lines
	// configured with this option is removed. If an empty line is specified the buffer is cleared (hence, in order to insert an
	// empty line, add an additional "\n" to the end or beginning of a line).
	//
	// StandardInputData= accepts arbitrary binary data, encoded in Base64. No escape sequences or specifiers are resolved.
	// Any whitespace in the encoded version is ignored during decoding.
	//
	// Note that StandardInputText= and StandardInputData= operate on the same data buffer, and may be mixed in order to configure
	// both binary and textual data for the same input stream. The textual or binary data is joined strictly in the order the settings

	// Configures filtering by log level of log messages generated by this unit. Takes a syslog log level, one of emerg (lowest
	// log level, only highest priority messages), alert, crit, err, warning, notice, info, debug (highest log level, also lowest
	// priority messages). See syslog for details. By default no filtering is applied (i.e. the default maximum log level is debug).
	// Use this option to configure the logging system to drop log messages of a specific service above the specified level. For

	// is applied early in the logging pipeline, before any kind of further processing is done. Moreover, messages which pass
	// through this filter successfully might still be dropped by filters applied at a later stage in the logging subsystem. For
	// example, MaxLevelStore= configured in journald.conf might prohibit messages of higher log levels to be stored on disk,

	// Configures additional log metadata fields to include in all log records generated by processes associated with this unit,

	// Define an extended regular expression to filter log messages based on the MESSAGE= field of the structured message. If

	//
	// Because the "~" character is used to define denied patterns, it must be replaced with "\x7e" to allow a message starting

	// Run the unit's processes in the specified journal namespace. Expects a short user-defined string identifying the namespace.
	// If not used the processes of the service are run in the default journal namespace, i.e. their log stream is collected and

	// independent from the default log namespace's data store. See systemd-journald.service for details about journal namespaces.
	//
	// Internally, journal namespaces are implemented through Linux mount namespacing and over-mounting the directory that

	// BPFProgram= allows attaching custom BPF programs to the cgroup of a unit. (This generalizes the functionality exposed

	// to the BPF filesystem are attached with cgroup-bpf attach flags determined by the unit. For details about attachment types
	// and flags see bpf.h. Also refer to the general BPF documentation.
	//
	// The specification of BPF program consists of a pair of BPF program type and program path in the file system, with ":" as the
	// separator: type:program-path.
	//
	// The BPF program type is equivalent to the BPF attach type used in bpftool It may be one of egress, ingress, sock_create, sock_ops,

	BPFProgram systemdconf.Value

	// Control access to specific device nodes by the executed processes. Takes two space-separated strings: a device node specifier

	// respectively. This functionality is implemented using eBPF filtering.
	//
	// When access to all physical devices should be disallowed, PrivateDevices= may be used instead. See systemd.exec.
	//
	// The device node specifier is either a path to a device node in the file system, starting with /dev/, or a string starting with
	// either "char-" or "block-" followed by a device group name, as listed in /proc/devices. The latter is useful to allow-list
	// all current and future devices belonging to a specific device group at once. The device group is matched according to filename
	// globbing rules, you may hence use the "*" and "?" wildcards. (Note that such globbing wildcards are not available for device
	// node path specifications!) In order to match device nodes by numeric major/minor, use device node paths in the /dev/char/
	// and /dev/block/ directories. However, matching devices by major/minor is generally not recommended as assignments
	// are neither stable nor portable between systems or different kernel versions.
	//
	// Examples: /dev/sda5 is a path to a device node, referring to an ATA or SCSI block device. "char-pts" and "char-alsa" are
	// specifiers for all pseudo TTYs and all ALSA sound devices, respectively. "char-cpu/*" is a specifier matching all CPU
	// related device groups.
	//
	// Note that allow lists defined this way should only reference device groups which are resolvable at the time the unit is started.
	// Any device groups not resolvable then are not added to the device allow list. In order to work around this limitation, consider
	// extending service units with a pair of After=modprobe@xyz.service and Wants=modprobe@xyz.service lines that load

	// group, so that a clear concept of ownership is established: the control group tree at the level of the unit's control group
	// and above (i.e. towards the root control group) is owned and managed by the service manager of the host, while the control
	// group tree below the unit's control group is owned and managed by the unit itself.
	//
	// Takes either a boolean argument or a (possibly empty) list of control group controller names. If true, delegation is turned
	// on, and all supported controllers are enabled for the unit, making them available to the unit's processes for management.
	// If false, delegation is turned off entirely (and no additional controllers are enabled). If set to a list of controllers,

	// slice unit or other units contained in it. Defaults to false.
	//
	// Note that controller delegation to less privileged code is only safe on the unified control group hierarchy. Accordingly,

	// Place unit processes in the specified subgroup of the unit's control group. Takes a valid control group name (not a path!)

	// to ExecStart=, but not for ExecReload= and similar. If delegation is enabled, the latter are always placed inside a subgroup
	// named .control. The specified subgroup is automatically created (and potentially ownership is passed to the unit's configured
	// user/group) when a process is started in it.
	//
	// This option is useful to avoid manually moving the invoked process into a subgroup after it has been started. Since no processes

	// cgroup has one of these properties set to kill, a unit with auto can still be a candidate for systemd-oomd to terminate.
	//
	// Added in version 247.
	ManagedOOMSwap systemdconf.Value

	// Specifies how systemd-oomd.service will act on this unit's cgroups. Defaults to auto.
	//
	// When set to kill, the unit becomes a candidate for monitoring by systemd-oomd. If the cgroup passes the limits set by oomd.conf
	// or the unit configuration, systemd-oomd will select a descendant cgroup and send SIGKILL to all of the processes under
	// it. You can find more details on candidates and kill behavior at systemd-oomd.service and oomd.conf.
	//
	// Setting either of these properties to kill will also result in After= and Wants= dependencies on systemd-oomd.service
	// unless DefaultDependencies=no.

	// When set to auto, systemd-oomd will not actively use this cgroup's data for monitoring and detection. However, if an ancestor
	// cgroup has one of these properties set to kill, a unit with auto can still be a candidate for systemd-oomd to terminate.
	//
	// Added in version 247.
	ManagedOOMMemoryPressure systemdconf.Value

	// Overrides the default memory pressure limit set by oomd.conf for the cgroup of this unit. Takes a percentage value between
	// 0% and 100%, inclusive. Defaults to 0%, which means to use the default set by oomd.conf. This property is ignored unless
	// ManagedOOMMemoryPressure=kill.
	//
	// Added in version 247.
	ManagedOOMMemoryPressureLimit systemdconf.Value

	// Overrides the default memory pressure duration set by oomd.conf for the cgroup of this unit. The specified value supports
	// a time unit such as "ms" or "Î¼s", see systemd.time for details on the permitted syntax. Must be set to either empty or a value
	// of at least 1s. Defaults to empty, which means to use the default set by oomd.conf. This property is ignored unless ManagedOOMMemoryPressure=kill.
	//
	// Added in version 257.
	ManagedOOMMemoryPressureDurationSec systemdconf.Value

	// Allows deprioritizing or omitting this unit's cgroup as a candidate when systemd-oomd needs to act. Requires support
	// for extended attributes (see xattr) in order to use avoid or omit.
	//
	// When calculating candidates to relieve swap usage, systemd-oomd will only respect these extended attributes if the unit's
	// cgroup is owned by root.
	//
	// When calculating candidates to relieve memory pressure, systemd-oomd will only respect these extended attributes if
	// the unit's cgroup is owned by root, or if the unit's cgroup owner, and the owner of the monitored ancestor cgroup are the same.
	// For example, if systemd-oomd is calculating candidates for -.slice, then extended attributes set on descendants of /user.slice/user-1000.slice/user@1000.service/
	// will be ignored because the descendants are owned by UID 1000, and -.slice is owned by UID 0. But, if calculating candidates
	// for /user.slice/user-1000.slice/user@1000.service/, then extended attributes set on the descendants would be respected.
	//
	// If this property is set to avoid, the service manager will convey this to systemd-oomd, which will only select this cgroup
	// if there are no other viable candidates.
	//
	// If this property is set to omit, the service manager will convey this to systemd-oomd, which will ignore this cgroup as a
	// candidate and will not perform any actions on it.
	//
	// It is recommended to use avoid and omit sparingly, as it can adversely affect systemd-oomd's kill behavior. Also note that
	// these extended attributes are not applied recursively to cgroups under this unit's cgroup.
	//
	// Defaults to none which means systemd-oomd will rank this unit's cgroup as defined in systemd-oomd.service and oomd.conf.
	//
	// Added in version 248.
	ManagedOOMPreference systemdconf.Value

	// Controls memory pressure monitoring for invoked processes. Takes a boolean or one of "auto" and "skip". If "no", tells
	// the service not to watch for memory pressure events, by setting the $MEMORY_PRESSURE_WATCH environment variable to the
	// literal string /dev/null. If "yes", tells the service to watch for memory pressure events. This enables memory accounting
	// for the service, and ensures the memory.pressure cgroup attribute file is accessible for reading and writing by the service's
	// user. It then sets the $MEMORY_PRESSURE_WATCH environment variable for processes invoked by the unit to the file system
	// path to this file. The threshold information configured with MemoryPressureThresholdSec= is encoded in the $MEMORY_PRESSURE_WRITE
	// environment variable. If the "auto" value is set the protocol is enabled if memory accounting is anyway enabled for the
	// unit, and disabled otherwise. If set to "skip" the logic is neither enabled, nor disabled and the two environment variables
	// are not set.
	//
	// Note that services are free to use the two environment variables, but it is unproblematic if they ignore them. Memory pressure
	// handling must be implemented individually in each service, and usually means different things for different software.
	// For further details on memory pressure handling see Memory Pressure Handling in systemd.
	//
	// Services implemented using sd-event may use sd_event_add_memory_pressure to watch for and handle memory pressure events.
	//
	// If not explicit set, defaults to the DefaultMemoryPressureWatch= setting in systemd-system.conf.
	//
	// Added in version 254.
	MemoryPressureWatch systemdconf.Value

	// Sets the memory pressure threshold time for memory pressure monitor as configured via MemoryPressureWatch=. Specifies
	// the maximum allocation latency before a memory pressure event is signalled to the service, per 2s window. If not specified,
	// defaults to the DefaultMemoryPressureThresholdSec= setting in systemd-system.conf (which in turn defaults to 200ms).
	// The specified value expects a time unit such as "ms" or "Î¼s", see systemd.time for details on the permitted syntax.
	//
	// Added in version 254.
	MemoryPressureThresholdSec systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. This setting is used to enable coredump forwarding for containers that belong to this unit's
	// cgroup. Units with CoredumpReceive=yes must also be configured with Delegate=yes. Defaults to false.
	//
	// When systemd-coredump is handling a coredump for a process from a container, if the container's leader process is a descendant
	// of a cgroup with CoredumpReceive=yes and Delegate=yes, then systemd-coredump will attempt to forward the coredump to
	// systemd-coredump within the container. See also systemd-coredump.
	//
	// Added in version 255.
