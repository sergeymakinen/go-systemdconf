	Alias systemdconf.Value

	// The policy by which the MAC address should be set. The available policies are:
	//
	// 	persistent: If the hardware has a persistent MAC address, as most hardware should, and if it is used by the kernel, nothing
	// 	is done. Otherwise, a new MAC address is generated which is guaranteed to be the same on every boot for the given machine and
	// 	the given device, but which is otherwise random. This feature depends on ID_NET_NAME_* properties to exist for the link.
	// 	On hardware where these properties are not set, the generation of a persistent MAC address will fail.
	// 	random: If the kernel is using a random MAC address, nothing is done. Otherwise, a new address is randomly generated each
	// 	time the device appears, typically at boot. Either way, the random address will have the "unicast" and "locally administered"
	// 	bits set.
	// 	none: Keeps the MAC address assigned by the kernel. Or use the MAC address specified in MACAddress=.
	//
	// An empty string assignment is equivalent to setting "none".
	MACAddressPolicy systemdconf.Value

	// The interface MAC address to use. For this setting to take effect, MACAddressPolicy= must either be unset, empty, or "none".
	MACAddress systemdconf.Value

	// An ordered, space-separated list of policies by which the interface name should be set. NamePolicy= may be disabled by
	// specifying net.ifnames=0 on the kernel command line. Each of the policies may fail, and the first successful one is used.
	// The name is not set directly, but is exported to udev as the property ID_NET_NAME, which is, by default, used by a udev, rule
	// to set NAME. The available policies are:
	//
	// 	kernel: If the kernel claims that the name it has set for a device is predictable, then no renaming is performed.
	// 	database: The name is set based on entries in the udev's Hardware Database with the key ID_NET_NAME_FROM_DATABASE.
	// 	onboard: The name is set based on information given by the firmware for on-board devices, as exported by the udev property
	// 	ID_NET_NAME_ONBOARD. See systemd.net-naming-scheme.
	// 	slot: The name is set based on information given by the firmware for hot-plug devices, as exported by the udev property
	// 	ID_NET_NAME_SLOT. See systemd.net-naming-scheme.
	// 	path: The name is set based on the device's physical location, as exported by the udev property ID_NET_NAME_PATH. See
	// 	systemd.net-naming-scheme.
	// 	mac: The name is set based on the device's persistent MAC address, as exported by the udev property ID_NET_NAME_MAC. See
	// 	systemd.net-naming-scheme.
	// 	keep: If the device already had a name given by userspace (as part of creation of the device or a rename), keep it.
	NamePolicy systemdconf.Value

	// The interface name to use. This option has lower precedence than NamePolicy=, so for this setting to take effect, NamePolicy=
	// must either be unset, empty, disabled, or all policies configured there must fail. Also see the example below with "Name=dmz0".
	//
	// Note that specifying a name that the kernel might use for another interface (for example "eth0") is dangerous because the
	// name assignment done by udev will race with the assignment done by the kernel, and only one interface may use the name. Depending
	// on the order of operations, either udev or the kernel will win, making the naming unpredictable. It is best to use some different
	// prefix, for example "internal0"/"external0" or "lan0"/"lan1"/"lan3".
	Name systemdconf.Value

	// A space-separated list of policies by which the interface's alternative names should be set. Each of the policies may fail,

	// the kernel does not support the alternative names, then this setting will be ignored.
	AlternativeNamesPolicy systemdconf.Value

	// The alternative interface name to use. This option can be specified multiple times. If the empty string is assigned to this

	Duplex systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean. If set to yes, automatic negotiation of transmission parameters is enabled. Autonegotiation is a procedure
	// by which two connected ethernet devices choose common transmission parameters, such as speed, duplex mode, and flow control.
	// When unset, the kernel's default will be used.
	//
	// Note that if autonegotiation is enabled, speed and duplex settings are read-only. If autonegotiation is disabled, speed
	// and duplex settings are writable if the driver supports multiple link modes.
	AutoNegotiation systemdconf.Value

	// The Wake-on-LAN policy to set for the device. The supported values are:
	//
	// 	phy: Wake on PHY activity.
	// 	unicast: Wake on unicast messages.
	// 	multicast: Wake on multicast messages.
	// 	broadcast: Wake on broadcast messages.
