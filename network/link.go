	// The policy by which the MAC address should be set. The available policies are:

	//	is done. Otherwise, a new MAC address is generated which is guaranteed to be the same on every boot for the given machine and
	//	the given device, but which is otherwise random. This feature depends on ID_NET_NAME_* properties to exist for the link.
	//	On hardware where these properties are not set, the generation of a persistent MAC address will fail.
	//
	//	Added in version 211.
	//	random: If the kernel is using a random MAC address, nothing is done. Otherwise, a new address is randomly generated each
	//	time the device appears, typically at boot. Either way, the random address will have the "unicast" and "locally administered"
	//	bits set.
	//
	//	Added in version 211.
	//	none: Keeps the MAC address assigned by the kernel. Or use the MAC address specified in MACAddress=.
	//
	//	Added in version 227.
	//
	// An empty string assignment is equivalent to setting "none".
	//
	// Added in version 211.
	MACAddressPolicy systemdconf.Value

	MACAddress systemdconf.Value

	// An ordered, space-separated list of policies by which the interface name should be set. NamePolicy= may be disabled by
	// specifying net.ifnames=0 on the kernel command line. Each of the policies may fail, and the first successful one is used.
	// The name is not set directly, but is exported to udev as the property ID_NET_NAME, which is, by default, used by a udev, rule
	// to set NAME. The available policies are:
	//
	//	kernel: If the kernel claims that the name it has set for a device is predictable, then no renaming is performed.
	//
	//	Added in version 216.
	//	database: The name is set based on entries in the udev's Hardware Database with the key ID_NET_NAME_FROM_DATABASE.
	//
	//	Added in version 211.
	//	onboard: The name is set based on information given by the firmware for on-board devices, as exported by the udev property

	//
	//	Added in version 211.

	//	Added in version 211.

	//
	//	Added in version 211.

	//	Added in version 241.
	//
	// Added in version 211.
	NamePolicy systemdconf.Value

	// The interface name to use. This option has lower precedence than NamePolicy=, so for this setting to take effect, NamePolicy=
	// must either be unset, empty, disabled, or all policies configured there must fail. Also see the example below with "Name=dmz0".
	//
	// Note that specifying a name that the kernel might use for another interface (for example "eth0") is dangerous because the
	// name assignment done by udev will race with the assignment done by the kernel, and only one interface may use the name. Depending
	// on the order of operations, either udev or the kernel will win, making the naming unpredictable. It is best to use some different
	// prefix, for example "internal0"/"external0" or "lan0"/"lan1"/"lan3".
	//
	// Interface names must have a minimum length of 1 character and a maximum length of 15 characters, and may contain any 7bit
	// ASCII character, with the exception of control characters, ":", "/" and "%". While "." is an allowed character, it is recommended
	// to avoid it when naming interfaces as various tools (such as resolvconf) use it as separator character. Also, fully numeric
	// interface names are not allowed (in order to avoid ambiguity with interface specification by numeric indexes), nor are
	// the special strings ".", "..", "all" and "default".

	// Added in version 211.
	Name systemdconf.Value

	// A space-separated list of policies by which the interface's alternative names should be set. Each of the policies may fail,

	AlternativeNamesPolicy systemdconf.Value

	//
	// Alternative interface names may be used to identify interfaces in various tools. In contrast to the primary name (as configured
	// with Name= above) there may be multiple alternative names referring to the same interface. Alternative names may have

	// to the same naming constraints.
	//
	// Added in version 245.

	// Takes a boolean. If set to yes, automatic negotiation of transmission parameters is enabled. Autonegotiation is a procedure
	// by which two connected ethernet devices choose common transmission parameters, such as speed, duplex mode, and flow control.
	// When unset, the kernel's default will be used.

	//	secureon: Enable SecureOn password for MagicPacket. Implied when WakeOnLanPassword= is specified. If specified without
