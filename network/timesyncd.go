	// A space-separated list of NTP server host names or IP addresses. During runtime this list is combined with any per-interface
	// NTP servers acquired from systemd-networkd.service. systemd-timesyncd will contact all configured system or per-interface
	// servers in turn until one is found that responds. When the empty string is assigned, the list of NTP servers is reset, and
	// all assignments prior to this one will have no effect. This setting defaults to an empty list.

	// A space-separated list of NTP server host names or IP addresses to be used as the fallback NTP servers. Any per-interface
	// NTP servers obtained from systemd-networkd.service take precedence over this setting, as do any servers set via NTP=
	// above. This setting is hence only used if no other NTP server information is known. When the empty string is assigned, the
	// list of NTP servers is reset, and all assignments prior to this one will have no effect. If this option is not given, a compiled-in
	// list of NTP servers is used instead.
