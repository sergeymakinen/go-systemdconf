	//
	// 	ip route add default dev veth99
	DefaultRouteOnDevice systemdconf.Value

	// Specifies an optional address generation mode for the Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC). Supported modes
	// are "prefixstable" and "static".
	//
	// When the mode is set to "static", an IPv6 address must be specified after a colon (":"), and the lower bits of the supplied
	// address are combined with the upper bits of a prefix received in a Router Advertisement (RA) message to form a complete address.
	// Note that if multiple prefixes are received in an RA message, or in multiple RA messages, addresses will be formed from each
	// of them using the supplied address. This mode implements SLAAC but uses a static interface identifier instead of an identifier
	// generated by using the EUI-64 algorithm. Because the interface identifier is static, if Duplicate Address Detection
	// detects that the computed address is a duplicate (in use by another node on the link), then this mode will fail to provide
	// an address for that prefix. If an IPv6 address without mode is specified, then "static" mode is assumed.
	//
	// When the mode is set to "prefixstable" the RFC 7217 algorithm for generating interface identifiers will be used. This mode
	// can optionally take an IPv6 address separated with a colon (":"). If an IPv6 address is specified, then an interface identifier
	// is generated only when a prefix received in an RA message matches the supplied address.
	//
	// If no address generation mode is specified (which is the default), or a received prefix does not match any of the addresses
	// provided in "prefixstable" mode, then the EUI-64 algorithm will be used to form an interface identifier for that prefix.
	// This mode is also SLAAC, but with a potentially stable interface identifier which does not directly map to the interface's
	// hardware address.
	//
	// Note that the "prefixstable" algorithm uses both the interface name and MAC address as input to the hash to compute the interface
	// identifier, so if either of those are changed the resulting interface identifier (and address) will change, even if the
	// prefix received in the RA message has not changed.
	//
	// This setting can be specified multiple times. If an empty string is assigned, then the all previous assignments are cleared.
	//
	// Examples:
	//
	// 	IPv6Token=::1a:2b:3c:4d IPv6Token=static:::1a:2b:3c:4d IPv6Token=prefixstable IPv6Token=prefixstable:2002:da8:1::

	// Takes a boolean or "allow-downgrade". When true, enables DNSSEC DNS validation support on the link. When set to "allow-downgrade",

	// A space-separated list of DNSSEC negative trust anchor domains. If specified and DNSSEC is enabled, look-ups done via

	// Controls support for Ethernet LLDP packet reception. LLDP is a link-layer protocol commonly implemented on professional
	// routers and bridges which announces which physical port a system is connected to, as well as other related data. Accepts
	// a boolean or the special value "routers-only". When true, incoming LLDP packets are accepted and a database of all LLDP
	// neighbors maintained. If "routers-only" is set only LLDP data of various types of routers is collected and LLDP data about
	// other types of devices ignored (such as stations, telephones and others). If false, LLDP reception is disabled. Defaults
	// to "routers-only". Use networkctl to query the collected neighbor data. LLDP is only available on Ethernet links. See
	// EmitLLDP= below for enabling LLDP packet emission from the local system.
	LLDP systemdconf.Value

	// Controls support for Ethernet LLDP packet emission. Accepts a boolean parameter or the special values "nearest-bridge",
	// "non-tpmr-bridge" and "customer-bridge". Defaults to false, which turns off LLDP packet emission. If not false, a short
	// LLDP packet with information about the local system is sent out in regular intervals on the link. The LLDP packet will contain
	// information about the local hostname, the local machine ID (as stored in machine-id) and the local interface name, as well
	// as the pretty hostname of the system (as set in machine-info). LLDP emission is only available on Ethernet links. Note that
	// this setting passes data suitable for identification of host to the network and should thus not be enabled on untrusted
	// networks, where such identification data should not be made available. Use this option to permit other systems to identify
	// on which interfaces they are connected to this system. The three special values control propagation of the LLDP packets.
	// The "nearest-bridge" setting permits propagation only to the nearest connected bridge, "non-tpmr-bridge" permits
	// propagation across Two-Port MAC Relays, but not any other bridges, and "customer-bridge" permits propagation until
	// a customer bridge is reached. For details about these concepts, see IEEE 802.1AB-2016. Note that configuring this setting
	// to true is equivalent to "nearest-bridge", the recommended and most restricted level of propagation. See LLDP= above
	// for an option to enable LLDP reception.
	EmitLLDP systemdconf.Value

	// A link name or a list of link names. When set, controls the behavior of the current link. When all links in the list are in an

	// up.
	BindCarrier systemdconf.Value

	// A static IPv4 or IPv6 address and its prefix length, separated by a "/" character. Specify this key more than once to configure
	// several addresses. The format of the address must be as described in inet_pton. This is a short-hand for an [Address] section
	// only containing an Address key (see below). This option may be specified more than once.
	//
	// If the specified address is "0.0.0.0" (for IPv4) or "::" (for IPv6), a new address range of the requested size is automatically
	// allocated from a system-wide pool of unused ranges. Note that the prefix length must be equal or larger than 8 for IPv4, and
	// 64 for IPv6. The allocated range is checked against all current network interfaces and all known network configuration
	// files to avoid address range conflicts. The default system-wide pool consists of 192.168.0.0/16, 172.16.0.0/12 and
	// 10.0.0.0/8 for IPv4, and fd00::/8 for IPv6. This functionality is useful to manage a large number of dynamically created
	// network interfaces with the same network configuration and automatic address range assignment.
	Address systemdconf.Value

	// The gateway address, which must be in the format described in inet_pton. This is a short-hand for a [Route] section only
	// containing a Gateway key. This option may be specified more than once.
	Gateway systemdconf.Value

	// A DNS server address, which must be in the format described in inet_pton. This option may be specified more than once. Each
	// address can optionally take a port number separated with ":", a network interface name or index separated with "%", and
	// a Server Name Indication (SNI) separated with "#". When IPv6 address is specified with a port number, then the address must
	// be in the square brackets. That is, the acceptable full formats are "111.222.333.444:9953%ifname#example.com" for
	// IPv4 and "[1111:2222::3333]:9953%ifname#example.com" for IPv6. This setting can be specified multiple times. If an
	// empty string is assigned, then the all previous assignments are cleared. This setting is read by systemd-resolved.service.
	DNS systemdconf.Value

	// A whitespace-separated list of domains which should be resolved using the DNS servers on this link. Each item in the list
	// should be a domain name, optionally prefixed with a tilde ("~"). The domains with the prefix are called "routing-only domains".
	// The domains without the prefix are called "search domains" and are first used as search suffixes for extending single-label
	// hostnames (hostnames containing no dots) to become fully qualified domain names (FQDNs). If a single-label hostname
	// is resolved on this interface, each of the specified search domains are appended to it in turn, converting it into a fully
	// qualified domain name, until one of them may be successfully resolved.
	//
	// Both "search" and "routing-only" domains are used for routing of DNS queries: look-ups for hostnames ending in those domains
	// (hence also single label names, if any "search domains" are listed), are routed to the DNS servers configured for this interface.
	// The domain routing logic is particularly useful on multi-homed hosts with DNS servers serving particular private DNS
	// zones on each interface.
	//
	// The "routing-only" domain "~." (the tilde indicating definition of a routing domain, the dot referring to the DNS root
	// domain which is the implied suffix of all valid DNS names) has special effect. It causes all DNS traffic which does not match
	// another configured domain routing entry to be routed to DNS servers specified for this interface. This setting is useful
	// to prefer a certain set of DNS servers if a link on which they are connected is available.
	//
	// This setting is read by systemd-resolved.service. "Search domains" correspond to the domain and search entries in resolv.conf.
	// Domain name routing has no equivalent in the traditional glibc API, which has no concept of domain name servers limited
	// to a specific link.
	Domains systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. If true, this link's configured DNS servers are used for resolving domain names that do not match
	// any link's configured Domains= setting. If false, this link's configured DNS servers are never used for such domains,
	// and are exclusively used for resolving names that match at least one of the domains configured on this link. If not specified
	// defaults to an automatic mode: queries not matching any link's configured domains will be routed to this link if it has no
	// routing-only domains configured.
	DNSDefaultRoute systemdconf.Value

	// An NTP server address (either an IP address, or a hostname). This option may be specified more than once. This setting is
	// read by systemd-timesyncd.service.
	NTP systemdconf.Value

	// Configures IP packet forwarding for the system. If enabled, incoming packets on any network interface will be forwarded
	// to any other interfaces according to the routing table. Takes a boolean, or the values "ipv4" or "ipv6", which only enable
	// IP packet forwarding for the specified address family. This controls the net.ipv4.ip_forward and net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding
	// sysctl options of the network interface (see ip-sysctl.txt for details about sysctl options). Defaults to "no".
	//
	// Note: this setting controls a global kernel option, and does so one way only: if a network that has this setting enabled is
	// set up the global setting is turned on. However, it is never turned off again, even after all networks with this setting enabled
	// are shut down again.
	//
	// To allow IP packet forwarding only between specific network interfaces use a firewall.
	IPForward systemdconf.Value

	// Configures IP masquerading for the network interface. If enabled, packets forwarded from the network interface will
	// be appear as coming from the local host. Takes a boolean argument. Implies IPForward=ipv4. Defaults to "no".
	IPMasquerade systemdconf.Value

	// Configures use of stateless temporary addresses that change over time (see RFC 4941, Privacy Extensions for Stateless
	// Address Autoconfiguration in IPv6). Takes a boolean or the special values "prefer-public" and "kernel". When true, enables
	// the privacy extensions and prefers temporary addresses over public addresses. When "prefer-public", enables the privacy
	// extensions, but prefers public addresses over temporary addresses. When false, the privacy extensions remain disabled.
	// When "kernel", the kernel's default setting will be left in place. Defaults to "no".
	IPv6PrivacyExtensions systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean. Controls IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) reception support for the interface. If true, RAs are accepted;
	// if false, RAs are ignored. When RAs are accepted, they may trigger the start of the DHCPv6 client if the relevant flags are
	// set in the RA data, or if no routers are found on the link. The default is to disable RA reception for bridge devices or when
	// IP forwarding is enabled, and to enable it otherwise. Cannot be enabled on bond devices and when link local addressing is
	// disabled.
	//
	// Further settings for the IPv6 RA support may be configured in the [IPv6AcceptRA] section, see below.
	//
	// Also see ip-sysctl.txt in the kernel documentation regarding "accept_ra", but note that systemd's setting of 1 (i.e.
	// true) corresponds to kernel's setting of 2.
	//
	// Note that kernel's implementation of the IPv6 RA protocol is always disabled, regardless of this setting. If this option
	// is enabled, a userspace implementation of the IPv6 RA protocol is used, and the kernel's own implementation remains disabled,
	// since systemd-networkd needs to know all details supplied in the advertisements, and these are not available from the
	// kernel if the kernel's own implementation is used.

	IPv6DuplicateAddressDetection systemdconf.Value

	// Configures IPv6 Hop Limit. For each router that forwards the packet, the hop limit is decremented by 1. When the hop limit
	// field reaches zero, the packet is discarded. When unset, the kernel's default will be used.
	IPv6HopLimit systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean. Accept packets with local source addresses. In combination with suitable routing, this can be used to
	// direct packets between two local interfaces over the wire and have them accepted properly. When unset, the kernel's default
	// will be used.
	IPv4AcceptLocal systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean. Configures proxy ARP for IPv4. Proxy ARP is the technique in which one host, usually a router, answers ARP
	// requests intended for another machine. By "faking" its identity, the router accepts responsibility for routing packets
	// to the "real" destination. See RFC 1027. When unset, the kernel's default will be used.
	IPv4ProxyARP systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean. Configures proxy NDP for IPv6. Proxy NDP (Neighbor Discovery Protocol) is a technique for IPv6 to allow
	// routing of addresses to a different destination when peers expect them to be present on a certain physical link. In this
	// case a router answers Neighbour Advertisement messages intended for another machine by offering its own MAC address as
	// destination. Unlike proxy ARP for IPv4, it is not enabled globally, but will only send Neighbour Advertisement messages
	// for addresses in the IPv6 neighbor proxy table, which can also be shown by ip -6 neighbour show proxy. systemd-networkd
	// will control the per-interface `proxy_ndp` switch for each configured interface depending on this option. When unset,
	// the kernel's default will be used.
	IPv6ProxyNDP systemdconf.Value

	// An IPv6 address, for which Neighbour Advertisement messages will be proxied. This option may be specified more than once.
	// systemd-networkd will add the IPv6ProxyNDPAddress= entries to the kernel's IPv6 neighbor proxy table. This option implies

	IPv6ProxyNDPAddress systemdconf.Value

	// Whether to enable or disable Router Advertisement sending on a link. Takes a boolean value. When enabled, prefixes configured

	IPv6SendRA systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean value. When enabled, requests prefixes using a DHCPv6 client configured on another link. By default, an

	Xfrm systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean or one of "static", "dhcp-on-stop", "dhcp". When "static", systemd-networkd will not drop static addresses
