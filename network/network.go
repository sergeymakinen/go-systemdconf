	RequiredFamilyForOnline systemdconf.Value

	// Specifies the policy for systemd-networkd managing the link administrative state. Specifically, this controls how
	// systemd-networkd changes the network device's "IFF_UP" flag, which is sometimes controlled by system administrators
	// by running e.g., ip link set dev eth0 up or ip link set dev eth0 down, and can also be changed with networkctl up eth0 or networkctl
	// down eth0.
	//
	// Takes one of "up", "always-up", "manual", "always-down", "down", or "bound". When "manual", systemd-networkd will
	// not change the link's admin state automatically; the system administrator must bring the interface up or down manually,
	// as desired. When "up" (the default) or "always-up", or "down" or "always-down", systemd-networkd will set the link up
	// or down, respectively, when the interface is (re)configured. When "always-up" or "always-down", systemd-networkd
	// will set the link up or down, respectively, any time systemd-networkd detects a change in the administrative state. When
	// BindCarrier= is also set, this is automatically set to "bound" and any other value is ignored.
	//
	// When the policy is set to "down" or "manual", the default value of RequiredForOnline= is "no". When the policy is set to "always-down",
	// the value of RequiredForOnline= forced to "no".
	//
	// The administrative state is not the same as the carrier state, so using "always-up" does not mean the link will never lose
	// carrier. The link carrier depends on both the administrative state as well as the network device's physical connection.
	// However, to avoid reconfiguration failures, when using "always-up", IgnoreCarrierLoss= is forced to true.
	//

	// networks, where such identification data should not be made available. Use this option to permit other systems to identify
	// on which interfaces they are connected to this system. The three special values control propagation of the LLDP packets.
	// The "nearest-bridge" setting permits propagation only to the nearest connected bridge, "non-tpmr-bridge" permits
	// propagation across Two-Port MAC Relays, but not any other bridges, and "customer-bridge" permits propagation until

	BindCarrier systemdconf.Value

	// A static IPv4 or IPv6 address and its prefix length, separated by a "/" character. Specify this key more than once to configure

	//
	// If the specified address is "0.0.0.0" (for IPv4) or "::" (for IPv6), a new address range of the requested size is automatically
	// allocated from a system-wide pool of unused ranges. Note that the prefix length must be equal or larger than 8 for IPv4, and
	// 64 for IPv6. The allocated range is checked against all current network interfaces and all known network configuration
	// files to avoid address range conflicts. The default system-wide pool consists of 192.168.0.0/16, 172.16.0.0/12 and
	// 10.0.0.0/8 for IPv4, and fd00::/8 for IPv6. This functionality is useful to manage a large number of dynamically created

	// Added in version 211.
	Gateway systemdconf.Value

	// A DNS server address, which must be in the format described in inet_pton. This option may be specified more than once. Each

	// Added in version 211.
	DNS systemdconf.Value

	// Specifies the protocol-independent default value for the same settings in [IPv6AcceptRA], [DHCPv4], and [DHCPv6] sections

	//
	// Added in version 256.
	UseDomains systemdconf.Value

	// A whitespace-separated list of domains which should be resolved using the DNS servers on this link. Each item in the list
	// should be a domain name, optionally prefixed with a tilde ("~"). The domains with the prefix are called "routing-only domains".
	// The domains without the prefix are called "search domains" and are first used as search suffixes for extending single-label
	// hostnames (hostnames containing no dots) to become fully qualified domain names (FQDNs). If a single-label hostname
	// is resolved on this interface, each of the specified search domains are appended to it in turn, converting it into a fully
	// qualified domain name, until one of them may be successfully resolved.
	//
	// Both "search" and "routing-only" domains are used for routing of DNS queries: look-ups for hostnames ending in those domains
	// (hence also single label names, if any "search domains" are listed), are routed to the DNS servers configured for this interface.
	// The domain routing logic is particularly useful on multi-homed hosts with DNS servers serving particular private DNS
	// zones on each interface.
	//
	// The "routing-only" domain "~." (the tilde indicating definition of a routing domain, the dot referring to the DNS root
	// domain which is the implied suffix of all valid DNS names) has special effect. It causes all DNS traffic which does not match
	// another configured domain routing entry to be routed to DNS servers specified for this interface. This setting is useful
	// to prefer a certain set of DNS servers if a link on which they are connected is available.
	//
	// This setting is read by systemd-resolved.service. "Search domains" correspond to the domain and search entries in resolv.conf.
	// Domain name routing has no equivalent in the traditional glibc API, which has no concept of domain name servers limited

	// Added in version 216.
	Domains systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean argument. If true, this link's configured DNS servers are used for resolving domain names that do not match

	// routing-only domains configured.
	//
	// Added in version 240.
	DNSDefaultRoute systemdconf.Value

	// An NTP server address (either an IP address, or a hostname). This option may be specified more than once. This setting is

	NTP systemdconf.Value

	// Configures IPv4 packet forwarding for the interface. Takes a boolean value. This controls the net.ipv4.conf.INTERFACE.forwarding
	// sysctl option of the network interface. See IP Sysctl for more details about the sysctl option. Defaults to true if IPMasquerade=
	// is enabled for IPv4, otherwise the value specified to the same setting in networkd.conf will be used. If none of them are

	IPv4Forwarding systemdconf.Value

	// Configures interface-specific host/router behaviour. Takes a boolean value. This controls the net.ipv6.conf.INTERFACE.forwarding

	//
	// To control the global setting, use the same setting in networkd.conf.
	//
	// Note, unlike IPv4Forwarding=, enabling per-interface IPv6Forwarding= on two or more interfaces DOES NOT make IPv6 packets
	// forwarded within the interfaces. This setting just controls the per-interface sysctl value, and the sysctl value is not
	// directly correlated to whether packets are forwarded. To ensure IPv6 packets forwarded, the global setting in networkd.conf
	// needs to be enabled.
	//
	// Added in version 256.
	IPv6Forwarding systemdconf.Value

	// Configures IP masquerading for the network interface. If enabled, packets forwarded from the network interface will
	// be appear as coming from the local host. Typically, this should be enabled on the downstream interface of routers. Takes
	// one of "ipv4", "ipv6", "both", or "no". Defaults to "no". Note that any positive boolean values such as "yes" or "true" are
	// now deprecated. Please use one of the values above. Specifying "ipv4" or "both" implies IPv4Forwarding= settings in both
	// .network file for this interface and the global networkd.conf unless they are explicitly specified. Similarly for IPv6Forwarding=
	// when "ipv6" or "both" is specified. See IPv4Forwarding=/IPv6Forwarding= in the above for the per-link settings, and

	IPMasquerade systemdconf.Value

	// Configures use of stateless temporary addresses that change over time (see RFC 4941, Privacy Extensions for Stateless
	// Address Autoconfiguration in IPv6). Takes a boolean or the special values "prefer-public" and "kernel". When true, enables

	// extensions, but prefers public addresses over temporary addresses. When false, the privacy extensions remain disabled.
	// When "kernel", the kernel's default setting will be left in place. When unspecified, the value specified in the same setting

	//
	// Added in version 222.
	IPv6PrivacyExtensions systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean. Controls IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) reception support for the interface. If true, RAs are accepted;
	// if false, RAs are ignored. When RAs are accepted, they may trigger the start of the DHCPv6 client if the relevant flags are
	// set in the RA data, or if no routers are found on the link. Defaults to false for bridge devices, when IPv6Forwarding=, IPv6SendRA=,
	// or KeepMaster= is enabled. Otherwise, enabled by default. Cannot be enabled on devices aggregated in a bond device or when
	// link-local addressing is disabled.
	//
	// Further settings for the IPv6 RA support may be configured in the [IPv6AcceptRA] section, see below.

	// Added in version 256.
	IPv6RetransmissionTimeSec systemdconf.Value

	// Configure IPv4 Reverse Path Filtering. If enabled, when an IPv4 packet is received, the machine will first check whether

	// routing of addresses to a different destination when peers expect them to be present on a certain physical link. In this
	// case, a router answers Neighbour Advertisement messages intended for another machine by offering its own MAC address
	// as destination. Unlike proxy ARP for IPv4, it is not enabled globally, but will only send Neighbour Advertisement messages
	// for addresses in the IPv6 neighbor proxy table, which can also be shown by ip -6 neighbour show proxy. systemd-networkd
	// will control the per-interface `proxy_ndp` switch for each configured interface depending on this option. When unset,
	// the kernel's default will be used.

	ActiveSlave systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean. Specifies which slave is the primary device. The specified device will always be the active slave while
	// it is available. Only when the primary is off-line will alternate devices be used. This is useful when one slave is preferred
	// over another, e.g. when one slave has higher throughput than another. The "PrimarySlave=" option is only valid for following

	//
	// With this enabled, to make the interface enter the "configured" state, which is required to make systemd-networkd-wait-online

	// enabled by default in most cases) need to be disabled. Also, DuplicateAddressDetection= (which is enabled by default
	// for IPv4 link-local addresses and all IPv6 addresses) needs to be disabled for all static address configurations. Otherwise,
	// without carrier, the interface will be stuck in the "configuring" state, and systemd-networkd-wait-online for the interface
	// will timeout. Also, it is recommended to set RequiredForOnline=no-carrier to make systemd-networkd-wait-online work
	// for the interface.
	//
	// Added in version 235.
	ConfigureWithoutCarrier systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean or a timespan. When true, systemd-networkd retains both the static and dynamic configuration of the interface
	// even if its carrier is lost. When false, systemd-networkd drops both the static and dynamic configuration of the interface.
	// When a timespan is specified, systemd-networkd waits for the specified timespan, and ignores the carrier loss if the link
	// regain its carrier within the timespan. Setting 0 seconds is equivalent to "no", and "infinite" is equivalent to "yes".
	//
	// Setting a finite timespan may be useful when e.g. in the following cases:
	//
	// A wireless interface connecting to a network which has multiple access points with the same SSID.
	//
	// Enslaving a wireless interface to a bond interface, which may disconnect from the connected access point and causes its
	// carrier to be lost.
	//
	// The driver of the interface resets when the MTU is changed.
	//
	// When Bond= is specified to a wireless interface, defaults to 3 seconds. When the DHCPv4 client is enabled and UseMTU= in
	// the [DHCPv4] section enabled, defaults to 5 seconds. Otherwise, defaults to the value specified with ConfigureWithoutCarrier=.
	// When ActivationPolicy= is set to "always-up", this is forced to "yes", and ignored any user specified values.
	//
	// Added in version 242.
	IgnoreCarrierLoss systemdconf.Value

	// Takes a boolean or one of "static", "dynamic-on-stop", and "dynamic". When "static", systemd-networkd will not drop
	// statically configured addresses and routes on starting up process. When "dynamic-on-stop", the dynamically configurad
	// addresses and routes, such as DHCPv4, DHCPv6, SLAAC, and IPv4 link-local address, will not be dropped when systemd-networkd
	// is being stopped. When "dynamic", the dynamically configured addresses and routes will never be dropped, and the lifetime
	// of DHCPv4 leases will be ignored. This is contrary to the DHCP specification, but may be the best choice if, e.g., the root
	// filesystem relies on this connection. The setting "dynamic" implies "dynamic-on-stop", and "yes" implies "dynamic"
	// and "static". Defaults to "dynamic-on-stop" when systemd-networkd is running in initrd, "yes" when the root filesystem
	// is a network filesystem, and "no" otherwise.

	AutoJoin systemdconf.Value

	// This setting provides a method for integrating static and dynamic network configuration into Linux NetLabel subsystem
	// rules, used by Linux Security Modules (LSMs) for network access control. The label, with suitable LSM rules, can be used
	// to control connectivity of (for example) a service with peers in the local network. At least with SELinux, only the ingress
	// can be controlled but not egress. The benefit of using this setting is that it may be possible to apply interface independent
	// part of NetLabel configuration at very early stage of system boot sequence, at the time when the network interfaces are
	// not available yet, with netlabelctl, and the per-interface configuration with systemd-networkd once the interfaces
	// appear later. Currently this feature is only implemented for SELinux.
	//
	// The option expects a single NetLabel label. The label must conform to lexical restrictions of LSM labels. When an interface
	// is configured with IP addresses, the addresses and subnetwork masks will be appended to the NetLabel Fallback Peer Labeling
	// rules. They will be removed when the interface is deconfigured. Failures to manage the labels will be ignored.
	//
	//	Warning
	//
	//	Once labeling is enabled for network traffic, a lot of LSM access control points in Linux networking stack go from dormant
	//	to active. Care should be taken to avoid getting into a situation where for example remote connectivity is broken, when
	//	the security policy has not been updated to consider LSM per-packet access controls and no rules would allow any network
	//	traffic. Also note that additional configuration with netlabelctl is needed.
	//
	// Example:
	//
	//	[Address] NetLabel=system_u:object_r:localnet_peer_t:s0
	//
	// With the example rules applying for interface "eth0", when the interface is configured with an IPv4 address of 10.0.0.123/8,
	// systemd-networkd performs the equivalent of netlabelctl operation
	//
	//	netlabelctl unlbl add interface eth0 address:10.0.0.0/8 label:system_u:object_r:localnet_peer_t:s0
	//
	// and the reverse operation when the IPv4 address is deconfigured. The configuration can be used with LSM rules; in case of
	// SELinux to allow a SELinux domain to receive data from objects of SELinux "peer" class. For example:
	//
	//	type localnet_peer_t; allow my_server_t localnet_peer_t:peer recv;
	//
	// The effect of the above configuration and rules (in absence of other rules as may be the case) is to only allow "my_server_t"
	// (and nothing else) to receive data from local subnet 10.0.0.0/8 of interface "eth0".
	//
	// Added in version 252.
	NetLabel systemdconf.Value

	// This setting provides a method for integrating network configuration into firewall rules with NFT sets. The benefit of
	// using the setting is that static network configuration (or dynamically obtained network addresses, see similar directives
	// in other sections) can be used in firewall rules with the indirection of NFT set types. For example, access could be granted
	// for hosts in the local subnetwork only. Firewall rules using IP address of an interface are also instantly updated when
	// the network configuration changes, for example via DHCP.
	//
	// This option expects a whitespace separated list of NFT set definitions. Each definition consists of a colon-separated
	// tuple of source type (one of "address", "prefix" or "ifindex"), NFT address family (one of "arp", "bridge", "inet", "ip",
	// "ip6", or "netdev"), table name and set name. The names of tables and sets must conform to lexical restrictions of NFT table
	// names. The type of the element used in the NFT filter must match the type implied by the directive ("address", "prefix" or
	// "ifindex") and address type (IPv4 or IPv6) as shown in the table below.
	//
	//	+-------------+-----------------+--------------------------------+
	//	| SOURCE TYPE |   DESCRIPTION   |  CORRESPONDING NFT TYPE NAME   |
